    "allText": "Love it! Love knowing when my kids are home from school as well as if my garage door actually closed. Works reliably needs more 3rd party integration I use chamberlain, along with homeseer home automation. \n\nWhen it is left open i am notified, and i can use an unlimited number of alerts, all just using myq.\n\nChamberlain used to be “open”, but they closed it down for some platforms. A good ha product should be open to work with everything from alexa to smartthings and everything else.\n\nUniversal compatibility would make this great product even better.\n\nIt gets 5 stars for this app, easy to program, fast, and doesn't crash. Would be great if you could count on it. It’s a great concept, and it works a lot of the time. But kind of like a parachute, this needs to work all the time. Frequent false open/closed statuses make this impossible to trust. Right now, it says my door is open but it it closed. False Notifications. Starting April 2018, the app began sending push notifications indicating that my garage door was left open when it’s actually closed. GREG It would not accept my half a dozen pass word I tried. NOT STRONG ENOUG?\nIt ridicules Software lacking Features like scheduling STILL don’t work. No Alexa support even though it was promised. Constant battle trying to get the software to run properly. Integration with IFTTT also buggy. There are better solutions out there. Fails all the time The developers of this app didn’t test for people driving up to their house and opening their garages as their network switches from LTE to their home WiFi. Once this network switch happens the whole system locks out and you have to sit for ten minutes out front of your house waiting for the dumb app to correct itself Failure to close This was one of my favorite apps, it was quick easy to use and brought simplicity and peace of mind. After the last update, it stopped working correctly. I can open my doors immediately but am unable to close them. The hub flashes and beeps but never sends a signal to close. I continually have to close the door manually. If I use my remote that came with the door, then they close fine and instantly. Not sure why I cant get the door to close from this app. No Amazon Echo integration Only Smarthome device that doesn't integrate to Amazon Echo. Slow and unreliable Works 2/3rds of the time. Would be great if it was more stable. Takes too long to load too. Recent update was a step backwards First of all the app works as described. It shows the status of my garage doors and allows remote opening and closing. Unfortunately the recent update has made the whole process take another step and the door status is not always in sync. This didn’t used to be the case. \n\nCurrently, the app auto logs in and shows the doors. Next you click on the door and a tab slides over to show the status. The status used to be visible without this step and selecting the door would simply open or close the door. Now if the door was opened from the house button the app will still show the status as closed. Selecting the option to “open” will spin the thinking wheel, realize the door is already open, and update the status. Well I wanted to toggle the door, you didn’t give me a close option, so you did nothing. \n\nEven when the app is working and showing the correct door status it takes 4 step instead of 3 to open a door. \n1) open app with auto login\n2) click on door\n3) click on open/close action\n4) thumbprint to authorize\n\nI used to use the app a lot more to open and close the doors and yes one extra step for every use is a big deal. Now I use the door keypad more and walk around to the other doors. \n\nPlease fix the app. Make it easier to open and fix the door status issue. It should be easy to auto check each door status when the app launches and get it correct. Please don’t make me click on the door to show the status and then that status is not even correct. Useless App only works when connected to WiFi. So if I’m out, and on the road, you can’t use it. Completely useless do not trust it at all almost been locked out of my house a few times. Weak Sauce No Alexa integration, app feels dated, not easy to update WiFi passwords App screenshots misleading The app no longer opens up to a large view of the garage door as the screenshots suggests.  Instead they’ve made it 1/10 the size and is very annoying to try and hit while approaching your house.  Please bring back the large view like shown in the App Store preview. Love Chamberlain, But Needs Improvement I’m big into smart home automation so this app is definitely one of my favorites! However, there is so much potential left on the table. The developers need to bring motion alerts and temperature monitoring to the app. I run server hardware in my garage and having these two features in the app would make a huge difference. Idiots. This app was fine, until the latest update. Apparently, some idiot thought that for an app you’re going to use in your car, it made sense to make the buttons smaller AND require a second press to confirm that yes, you do want to open your garage door. While you’re driving. No alexa integration Ok otherwise Less than one star; useless This is as minimal and bare bones as possible and it's quite useless. It allows opening and closing the door and nothing else in the app works on any of my phones or tablets. There are so many functions they could add but haven't. This is a POS. A fee to connect to IFTTT Look else where if you can!  I won’t buy another product from them. Last update Very rude customer service \nThe last update make this application worse and it's not working properly freezing with my face id on the screen.\n\nBefore you had  a chance to change from big garage icon and small to accommodate more doors and with one touch open and close the door.\nNow you still have 2 choices but the garage icon are the same and you need to touch twice the screen to open the garage door.\nInstead to make it easy they complicated this app...\nI'm an old person with an iPhone 5 and\nusing this app it's a nightmare the garage icon it's so small that I can't see it.\nDear Chamberlain if you want make something fancy, work on FACE ID without touching the screen.\nThank Chamberlain to make me nervous every time I use it.\nI apologize for my English Worst software EVER If you like crap you have come to the right spot, beyond hit and miss absolutely horrible.  Look at other companies and software over this always on the “blink” Yuck I am rarely compelled to write a negative review. But this app's interface is utterly pathetic. This company needs to hire experienced and skilled user interface designers. It is the most senseless layout and navigation that I have ever seen. It is mostly functional and works about 70% of the time. I have no idea why we live in a culture where that’s all we expect of products we pay for.  I am beyond disturbed by the ear piercingly loud beep played by the product before the garage door goes down, and I similarly can't stand the bright flashing strobe. I have opened up the hardware and removed the beeping element with a pliers, and I have duct taped over the strobe six times to stop the light from getting through. Why it is not an option to turn off the strobe or the beeper with settings - likely the same reason that the interface of the app is so pathetic. Key decision-makers behind this app and product are seriously out of touch with consumers. It won't be long before they are surpassed by more sensible competitors.  Lastly, why would you log users out of your app every time you update the app?  Your competitors don't.   You simply have no sense. Latest update Please revert back to the one tap opening feature. With the newest update I have smaller icons that I have to tap twice in order to open my garage door. I use with with my motorcycle so this isn't a welcomed feature. Make the icon larger Works good, but latest update makes the garage door icon too small, was fine before. Worthless Does not consistently work. Horrible Most inconsistent app I've used for home automation. Garage opens on its own. Partial close. Partial open. Sometimes works sometimes doesn't. Error after error gets annoying. No way of closing app fully when it's stuck and the wheel just spins. The setup instructions are garbage.  Don't waste your money. Awesome app and product I wish everything worked as great as this app!  Response time for opening and closing are amazing.  Kēvo Kwikset could learn some things from this app... Does more than I need I’ve had the app and hub in operation for about 2 years. The installation was okay, though I think they were written for someone who had installed similar Wi-Fi home automation devices. But it wasn’t all that difficult. \nPrior to installation I had a habit of driving off and not closing the garage door. I blamed it on low-flying airplanes, but it was all me. I’ve set alarms for 6, 12, 30, 60 minutes. One enhancement I’d like is a button on the app to suspend alarms for x minutes, and if the door was open at x+6 minutes, I’d get my first notification. The app works for me all day, every day. \nOn the other hand, I’ve taken a pass on buying the gizmo that would allow Alexa to operate the door. I can’t see how that is useful to me, and if it ain’t broke, why fix it?\nWhen I travel, I have a dog-sitter who visits several times a day. She enters the house via the garage, so the open and close notifications give me assurance that my pups are being cared for. I can even tell how long each visit is. App not working Worked fine for 4 days then said could not fine sever. Now app will not do anything when I hit login. Will not send email for new pass either. Please fix app!!!! Update Broke Apple Watch App The new update broke the Apple Watch app. The app will say that it’s updating, then show Door as Closed but the garage door icon continues to show the updating circular graphic. Reboot on watch and iPhone fixes nothing. QA testing people!!! Terrible and buggy HomeKit Terrible and buggy HomeKit Worst App I’ve Ever Used This is a perfect example of someone who created an app for a product for which they don’t understand the operation. I have been in the electronics industry for over 30 years and I have a smart home with over 40 devices that I’ve setup myself. To be fair, the setup on those other devices didn’t always go smoothly, but nothing compares to the My Q app. It has a whole host of bugs in it. I would give it zero stars if I could. The instructions are as clear as mud. The app times out within seconds of pressing a button. Sometimes an option button you need to select doesn’t even show up on the page. But if you refresh the page it miraculously shows up. I could go on and on. Once you decipher how to get your system programmed and working, it works OK. But getting to that point is very frustrating and I was ready to chuck the whole thing a number of times. Good luck with your setup. You’ll need it! Bad bad bad! I get constant false alerts on my phone that my garage door is up. I rush home from work only to find out that it is down! \nI have even been at home when I got the “garage up” later, yet the door never moved!! \nRight now the app is telling me that my garage door had been up for 12 days. \nI give up. Causes me more grief with false alarms!\nAlso the remote function works 50% at best. \nVery disappointed in this product. Great product and stable Does not work with Alexa. Please develop this. I suggest having Alexa announce when the garage door is opening or closing, when the door is open longer than X minutes between X-Y hours, and the ability to open and close door. Also a reporting features to state when the door was opened in the past 24 hours. Disappointed in the new update The latest update provides the user with only a very small icon to use when tapping the screen to open or close the garage door. The previous versions provided a large icon that was very easy to use especially while in the car. Please consider giving the user the option to choose the icon size. Thanks Locked out of my house again. Probably the 10th time I’ve been locked out. Don’t update! This app always worked until I did the most recent update.  Now the app won’t even respond when I type in my password and try to press login. Took away large icon With the recent update it now takes two steps to open my garage. Are used to just launch the application and then tap the garage door. Now I have to tap the garage door and then tap the open button. Don’t take away useful features. At least make it. configurable Never worry Before I bought this I can’t tell you how many times I turned around and went back to check if I had closed the garage! No worry now and if it does open I get a notification. I feel very safe. Latest update a step backwards Why in the world would you make the icon so small and crammed in the corner of the screen. Not sure who is writing this or QA’ing but they need to be questioned Great idea - can’t quite trust it When it works it’s great. But not 100% accurate - once in a awhile it will say door is closed when it’s open or vice versa. If high wind vibrates the garage door the sensor gets confused. A big point for us is checking to see if we remembered to shut the garage door when we’re gone - but just can’t quite trust it.\n\nAlso a recent app upgrade caused it to forget our door openers and I had to repeat the setup. I live in Minnesota - it’s COLD and SNOWY in February - bad time to have to back out the cars and need extra garage door cycles setting up the app. Grrrr. Anyway to update app to show a “Connection Status” So far I really like my garage door opener. However, there are times where the connection is lost and may take several minutes to reestablish connection. I have verified that I do have Plenty of WiFi where the equipment is mounted. There has also been times to when I open the door and then when I go to close it my device had lost connection. So my question is, is there a way you can add “connection status” to the info being shown to us on the app? Meaning if my wife leaves the house and I get a notification that the garage door is open but do not receive a notification that it has shut that I can verify to make sure the equipment is working and communicating properly? Otherwise I’m blowing up my wife’s phone trying to figure out if she actually shut the door. I could just close it yes, BUT, I would hate for it to really be closed and then I open it to where it loses connection and now my garage door is exposed...sometimes the connection is lost for 30min. This is why if we had a connection status saying the unit is currently connected to the WiFi or if it isn’t connected to WiFi when it loses connection that now I can actually trust the device when I see its current status. From there I would give this device a 5 star review because now there is a way you can confirm that everything is working properly.\n\n On a side note, I’ve also had issues to where it is really windy outside to where is causes my garage door to shake. When this happens the sensor thinks the garage door is going up and down. So whenever the Santa Anna winds come through here in California, I get notifications throughout the night saying my garage door is opening and closing. When I first saw this it freaked me and my wife out to where I grabbed the gun thinking somebody had broken in....wrong...so whenever this happens I just ignore the notifications which I really shouldn’t have to do but ehhh it is what it is.\n\nNot sure if anybody associated with the app actually reads these comments or relays info to the developers??? What Happened Since the latest update the garage door icon has shrunk significantly in size. Not a fan. After reading a few blogs in this topic there is no fix or way to go back to the larger icon. The only way I see this change as a positive is if you have multiple openers in the same app. I HATE this change. New update is bad App was great until they messed with something that was not broken . Now instead of a big picture of my garage I have a small one that requires an extra swipe to operate . No multi user support. There is no multi user access support and the company is telling everyone to share your account username and password to those that need access.  This is ridiculous! Works as expected but could be better It works well. My biggest complaint is that it can be hard to read when I’m on my bike, which is when I use the app the most. It would be helpful if the app used a different color to show if the door is open or closed. Either that or use a much larger font and/or a much bigger picture. Latest update makes NO sense Before the latest update, you opened the app, tapped the garage door icon.\n\nNow you have to open the app, tap the garage door icon, then tap Open to the far right of the icon you just tapped. \n\nHey, why make it harder to drive and open the door???? Delayed Notifications It freaks me out when I get messages stating that my garage door just open when I'm hours away from realizing the the notification was delayed by a couple of hours. I decided to test to see if it's just me being far away from the device so standing in front on my garage door, I opened and closed the door. 30 min later I get a notification that the door just open and closed. My modem/router is literally 3 feet away from the chamberlain device with no obstruction in site.\n\nI’ve been getting false alerts for the last couple of days! Battery is good and no wind. What’s going on here? Simple and reliable Well designed app that gives you what you want. Latest update is awful My garage icon “used” to be big. I would open my garage door with one touch. Now my icon is tiny & I have to touch once for “open” or “close” to show up. Then a second touch for the action to get done. This is ridiculous! Please return the app back to the bigger icon with one touch! Terrible app and product I have had this product and app for over a year. During that time I have experienced many glitches. The product and app are pieces of junk and I would not recommend anyone purchase them. The issues that I described below have existed since I owned the product, so clearly no one is assigned to fixing these problems, because they persist month over month.\n\n1. Garage door opening on its own. When you live in Minnesota and your garage door opens on its own and you don't know this can create huge problems. Wildlife getting in the garage because we live in a rural area, or pipes freezing in the winter.\n2. Garage door registering up on the app when it's really down and vice versa. This is a huge issue. If you're not home and you cannot tell whether the door is up or down this defeats the entire purpose of owning this product.\n3. The app has a function where you can create rules to close the door automatically. For example, you can create a rule to close the door at 6 PM every day. Every rule I try to create you'll get the same error message: \"Save schedule failed. The schedule cannot be saved at this time. Please check your Internet connection and try again.\" The issue is with the app. No rules will save and all you rules yield the same error message. This has nothing to do with my Internet connection. Disappointed with Apple Watch Excited to have my Apple Watch 3 so could leave my phone behind on runs/rides. Low and behold, the chamberlain app on my Apple Watch keeps saying “login on your phone for security purposes”. That’s great, I love being locked out with my phone in the house. App sure worked to close the door, but not open. FAIL. That’s twice. Crap App Can’t even log in!! Won’t work Device keeps disappearing It worked great for a month.  Now i get errors every other day on the app so no one can open or close the door.  I have to add the device over and over and it only works for a day or so.  It isn’t the battery either.  They need to fix the app or device otherwise I will be reporting it to the BBB to get my money back. Don’t waste your time, useless Don’t waste your time, useless Hate the new update The door icons a very small now, I liked it better the way it was. Echo Please make this compatible with the Echo Show. Help!! Why in this latest app update did MyQ add a slider and a second tap to open the door or turn a light on??? The single tap of the bulb or door icon simply worked!! It's bad enough we're fidgeting with an iPhone screen while driving to open the door now we have to navigate a slider and double tap??? Bring the single tap safe way back! There was NO reason to make this change. None.\n\nWhy do I constantly get endless scrolling at times sitting in my driveway waiting for the door to open and finally having to get out to let myself inside and walking to the garage door to open it? In the cold Seattle rain.\n\nI've pretty much gone back to using the regular remote defeating the purpose of why I bought this garage door opener. Does not support multiusers This app does not provide multiuser functionality and you need to share your username and password with your roommate/neighbor.\nAlso in case you wanna hook it up to IFTTT services, you need to pay the annual subscription fee!\nSo don’t waste your money on MyQ bridge. Doesn’t connect Have been trying to connect and it won’t connect, tried resetting everything just a pain. Good idea if it would work. I can’t say how many times I wish I could check my garage door from my phone. If it’s not broke leave alone I’ve owned this opener for a year like it however the changes you made five days ago are not good icon is too small put back the way it was much easier to use on I phone ‘ iwatch Please fix iwatch issue... stopped working and it’s annoying Latest update is bad In the old version, opening the door was much easier when approaching my house.  Now, the button is small, and I have to select my house before opening the door.  \n\nPlease allow us to revert to the old look if we have only 1 house/1 door. Update is disappointing! The latest update has two major problems: \n1) Now you now must tap *twice* to open or close a garage door. With the previous version it was a one-tap process. Now you tap once so that the Open or Close button will appear, then you tap on the button to actually operate the door. So this was meant to make it clear whether you are opening or closing but...\n2) On multiple occasions with the latest version, the app has incorrectly shown the open or closed state of the door. For example, if you close the door with the push button switch or keypad (not the app), the app still thinks the door is open. As a result, the app shows you the CLOSE button when the door is already closed! \n\nThis update is *not* an improvement! Great idea, but... I love the idea, and the alerts, but how is it possible to get a Door Open alert when the door has not moved??\nIf false alerts can’t be fixed, I’ll have to unplug the hub and remove the app. Stopped working after a bit Our garage door opened stopped working Know when it’s open The best feature is knowing when the door is opened. Broke Broke since last update.....need to stop updating it if your gonna break it every time New interface is awful Last update makes longtime interface very user unfriendly, shrunk icons much more difficult to see and use.\nWere already too many steps when trying to open garage door quickly, now they have added yet one more very annoying New update went from one click to two Why would I tap the door if I didn’t want to open or close it? Change back to tap to close or open instead of tap to then tap again whether you want to open or close it. Update deleted my garage door opener No idea what happened but now there are no devices in the app! New update as of 2/7/18 KILLED APP!!! Garage opener was working fine. Updated the app and now it will not communicate with the garage door. Useless update that killed the app. Why no iOS widget yet Would easily bump up to 5* if there was a widget. Right now with no native HomeKit support it’s not the easiest to use Danger! This app allows tu to easily disconnect your home from your iCloud account, which clears all settings. Why is this even a feature!? Car play? How about a CarPlay option? Other than that it’s laggy and slow mostly. Bridge works fine but home app says not responding This was not intuitive to setup and required me at least 5 resets to get it working properly. Anytime I open the Home app, the bridge says “not responding”... anymore I need to open the door, I will only use the Home app, not this app It was perfect, but.... The user interface of this app was perfect, you use to open the app and there was your garage door and after that there was only one click to open or close your garage door, but apparently, the genius designers of this app think that we are seating on our sofas when we use this app and they decided to add an extra click to the simple act of opening your garage door. Come on geniuses, 99% of the time we, the real people, use this app when we are behind the wheel either coming or leaving our homes, so we don't need the extra step to open or close the garage door. Love this product I used to drive around the block to see if I closed the garage door, but not since I installed my new opener from Chamberlain. Now I can just check my phone to see if it is open or closed. Great product! Latest update is a fail The latest update is horrible. It was nice after logging in to have a big door to tap on. Now I have to tap on this little garage door and then tap again to open or close. Two main problems I bought the Myq system sometime in 2016 at Home Depot for around $100. I bought it because someone stole my opener from my car and sometimes I would forget to close my door.\n\nThis system solved both issues for me at first. Not too long ago the app stopped working due to too many attempts. So I tried everything to get it going again.\n\nI reset my router and the MYq hub and reinstalled the app. It would work for a few days and then stop.\n\nI read the forums and found lots of people with the same problem and the Community Managers didn’t have a solution to the problem. \n\nThe error said that it had too many attempts and that’s why it failed.\n\nFinally I changed the battery in the door sensor and for the last couple weeks it has been working!!! If the app or forum could have told me to check my battery then I would be happy but no they only said I had too many attempts.\n\nIt said I had too many attempts on the first try!!!\n\nSecond issue and one of the main reasons I bought the system is/was being able to schedule the garage to close.\n\nFor example I could set up the app to close the door at 10:00pm if it was left open and it worked great!\n\nLast night I left the door open and my wife was a little upset with me this morning. So I figured since I had recently updated the app trying to fix the other issue maybe I needed to set up the schedule again.\n\nAfter several attempts to set up the schedule and the app allowing me to go all the way through the process even prompting me to put a name in for the event, like close at 10 or something like that, when I tried to save it the app tells me I can’t and I need to check my internet connection.\n\nHaving experience with the app and the moronic errors it produces I decided to check the forum instead of checking my internet connection as they suggested.\n\nTHEY DISABLED THIS FEATURE!!!\n\nThey don’t tell you in the app that it’s disabled they just let you make several attempts to set the schedule and tell you to check your internet.\n\nI would buy another chamberlain product if my life depended on it!!! I have two of their openers and have had several in the past but no more!!! Help! The app stopped working over a week ago. It tells me our password isn’t correct. It is. So I sent multiple emails asking to reset the password. It’s says Chamberlain will send an email for reset. Never get emails. Not going to spam/trash. Went on their website left an email there with contact number. No reply. Just sent another email at the site. Me or my husband our unable to use an app that we’ve been using with no problems for a couple of years. What gives?? App shows garage is open but it’s actually closed Ever since the most recent update, it shows the garage is open but it’s actually closed??? Hub changed I have one device listed and your user interface update has now forced me into a grid view. Rather than the one door shown (like in your advertised screenshot which is now inaccurate) I cannot have a one button access. This makes it dangerous for me to use because my one large button is now a very small one in the upper left corner that requires two button confirmation to continue. I HATE that I am forced to waste literally 90% of my screen and am forced to look away from the ROAD to look at the details on my phone and do a two button confirmation (rather than just push the middle of my phone ONCE without looking).  I was hands free. Now you’ve made it harder. Garage doors in list view, what the? Why anyone would think that removing the side by side view of multiple garage doors was smart is beyond me.  It wasn’t broke so why “fix” it?  I highly suggest the genius that thought of this reach down towards the ground, make a fist, and violently thrust the fist against their own throat.  Thanks. Awesome openers Love the operation, the quiet open/ close.  And seeing if we closed the door on my phone Pethatic product These people have not figured out the importance of the guest and . I got locked out because of one account. I understand it was my friend but he was able to change the password. So stupid of these people. I’m planing to sue them please join me for class action. My number is 918-812-1789. Finnicky and unreliable This app is hit or miss on connectivity. Much of the time it tells me \"server unavailable\" and will not allow me to control the door even though it still receives alerts when the door opens and closes. It has terrible trouble transitioning from wifi to 4G. Password Reset Start using cell phone text as option to reset password. Its giving me a false notification For some reason when i close the garage it says closed and then few minutes later its says closed now. I went to check and saw nothing happened since i closed it the first time.\nWeird Needs to work with alexa Great door opener.  Wish it work with alexa and google home:) The least reliable home network app I have NEST and a variety of GE smart devices controlled with assorted apps. The MyQ app is the least reliable of all. I don’t have a better recommendation, but at this point, after three years of poor performance I’m ready to move on and suggest you do also and choose a competitor product. Notifications stop every two weeks Notifications work well but stop every two weeks. Need to open the app and login to have them work again. Mediocre functionality at best... when it even works at all Very unreliable. I *often* get 'Error' messages that read \"The gateway or hub is offline. Please check the power and network connections. (309)\" My WiFi connection is strong. It just simply doesn't work much of the time. Even when it does work, I often get false positives. It will indicate that the door just opened, but I'll go outside to check, and it's still down. Furthermore, I've accidently left my garage door open all day, which has twice opened me up to garage burglaries, and this app didn't show that the door was up. I'd estimate that 25% of the time, it works 50% of the time, and 75% of the time, it works 0% of the time. Love it Great opener.  Love the app Alerts don't work Set up an alert to notify/email when garage door was open more than an hour. Left garage door open all night and never got an alert. Garage Door App. It worked, then it stopped working and I cannot get it do anything. Simple and great when it works. At least half the time it doesn't work, really frustrating!\n\nWhen it does work it's very simple and straightforward.\n\nMoved to 1 star because customer service is not helpful or responsive. Okay when set up But, golly, is this app fickle. It works fine for a while but, if anything changes, say that it looses connection to house WiFi for any length of time, I will then have to reset the device and try to reconnect to my house WiFi. And that takes repeated attempts. And then somehow it connects after doing just the same thing I did four or five time is a row. I always debate with myself whether the effort to reconnect it is worth my time. Like today, where I have decided that it is. And thus, the two stars. Used to work flawlessly - now notifications are buggy It would be so great to incorporate end user control over the piezo beeper and light flashing. \nIt would also be great that the emails notification comes from the exact name of the garage door - so it is immediately recognizable.\nThat aside - this app works (less then a weeks experience - if it acts up I'll write more later).\nSimple to install and appears to work as described - would recommend to others. Works well...when it works When the system is connected, it works as advertised. However, I have found it requires frequent reboots and/or complete resets of the initial garage door setup process. Have had too many phone calls from my wife and kids telling me, “the garage door opener doesn’t work again, Dad.” Incorrect notifications Haven't been receiving notifications lately. Also can't control garage door on my local wan or lan. Must have internet or else doesn't work. Their network always down and many times app doesn't work. Yes Like it Lackluster app that disappoints Have no clue what you all did to make this worse but congratulations!  This is a dog and you should be ashamed.  Worked great for about 8 months, now it’s just eating band width. Have the low battery issue with new batteries.  Fix this piece of junk please.\n———-\n17 Jan 18 update. It looks like low battery issue has been corrected or something.  I will upgrade to 4 stars as this app still seems buggy. Still no multi-user options??? It’s been over 1 year since their announcement and still no multi-user option for guests, workers, etc...  we have self driving cars, but apparently Chamberlain can’t do simple programming to their ‘smart’ app... Five star for app working well 2 stars for making the user pay for IOT. IFTTT connection should be free. I’m not paying for IFTTT Ok Randomly doesn't tell you the status of your door. Great system! Like the system, I can open garage with iPhone and works great. Safety feature Please have a feature where my app doesn’t open in my pocket. Other than it’s great Best thing ever We love our garage door opener. We can open and close it with our phones. We live in WV and when we go visit AL. We can open garage door in AL with our phones to let someone in our house. Use WiFi more than I thought I would It’s great for when our son forgets to close the door, whether I’m in bed, or 800 miles away. I can check it, close it, even open it if necessary. Also love the optional alerts for when it opens or closes. Helps me know when my kids get home. Good stuff I like the Champlin garage door opener and special for the MyQ wi-Fi remote control.\nI called today to get tech-support for my new phone log into MyQ. They treat me very nicely. Please fix app Locked of my house several times waiting for this app to respond. Love MyQ I don’t know how many times I have driven away from my house and wondered if my garage door was closed, turned around, returned home only to find my door closed.   MyQ allows me to use the app on my phone to save me time. I can open and close my door from anywhere in the world. Customer service The customer service from you guys was fantastic!!!! You made it so easy to get my issue fixed!!! Both reps were fantastic to talk with!!! Brian 广告能再多点吗？ 怎么刚开app就这么多广告？我花了200美金买个车库门子，就为了看广告？？！ Great app, one minor feature could be added This app is awesome, and very convenient. I do wish there could be support for Apple CarPlay. It would be so cool to be able to open/close the garage from my car’s control screen. It’s just a suggestion. The rest of the app’s functionality is perfect, the only problems I have ever run into is the safety sensor being blocked and that’s not even the App’s fault. So I give the app 5 stars. Fix the malfunction!!! Over 100 alerts in an hour is obnoxious and tolerable fix the malfunction!!!!! Flawless We absolutely love our MyQ garage door opener and app. The notifications when the door is open or closed is really helpful when we are out of town. Saves the extra time of having to go back home if I forgot to close the door. Being able to open or close from the app is handy. The history log is great as well. Opens and closes I’ve been using it for past year and it works great! Annoying pop ups. Any app that has pop ups constantly asking me to rate it gets an automatic 1 star. Maybe now it’ll stop asking. Handy This is a very handy app to keep tabs on my elderly mother’s comings and going’s. First WiFi opener No complaints, not even a glitch. Very reliable. It’s works but...... Many many little issues but it does work. It used to work perfectly I think their last update caused it to not work. Half the time it just says Error and I am not able to control it; only on the inside (which defeats the purpose). So I have to keep resetting it; at least twice a week. Works but no adaptability to other apps. This would be great to be able to use with Alexa, or IFTTT. Annoying pop ups. Stop asking me to rate your annoying app. Apple Watch app no longer available? What happened to the Apple Watch app? When working it is great throws off a lot of false notifications I have had my-q openers and bridges for a couple of years and have used the various versions of this app. When working it is great. A couple of years ago it worked flawlessly and consistently well. In the last year it gives of multiple frequent false notifications——at all hours. I have had the thing go off at 2am ten or more times in a row saying the door opened and closed the door opened and closed on and on!!!\nThe tech support always says to delete app and reset up the bridge and all openers like you did when you got it!!! This is pain as I have four openers at two houses and three bridges. And I have to climb on a ladder (garage ceilings are 10 feet high).  Also the alerts/notifications used to be immediate now they are delayed a bit. Not sure if there is a better product or not.  My guess is the product is great but the behind the scenes computers software etc are not as good as they used to be. Cant get alerts via notifications The only reason I want this product is to know when my door opens and closes. I don’t want to have to check the app to see the activity. I want a notification sent to my phone. I can’t get the alerts to work. The app won’t edit my info to include my phone number. It acts like it saved my edits but when I come back to it, the info is gone. My other opener is a Genie with the same feature and their app has no issues. This app is garbage! I’m constantly resetting my login password! Also, on my touch login, I have to retouch!\nPlease improve this price of crap! Easy install It took longer to get my ladder out to push the learn button than it did to set it up. Just wished it worked with Alexa. Works great with app update I wrote yesterday that the app was not working since an update. Learned today from very helpful support team that I needed a battery for the motion detector. \n\nTerrific support. no alerts after update 3.96.1 since last update 3.96.1 my alerts not working .... checked everything and even set up new alerts .... app opens and closes the door without any issue ... push alerts and emails not working please fix this update ... Horrible set up, bad connection, poor UI Spent over 30 minutes trying to install the “gateway” for each of my two garage door openers. The doors never connected to the gateways correctly, even though the units lit up. Simply doesn’t work. Comforting Love knowing that the house is safe. Could use improvement The app is ok, works most of the time, but is incredibly slow. I mean, it might be faster to send a letter home to your family, asking them to open the garage door. The app requires you to sign in. Every time. The Touch ID log in will only pop up 1/10 times, forcing you to re-enter your username. I don’t even want to imagine how annoying it must be for Face-ID. \n\nI’ve since resorted to sending up smoke signals whenever I start coming home, in hopes that I get inside my house before midnight. Awesome!! I've had the opener for two years now and I love it!! Works well and I never have to worry about if I forget to close the garage. Never works 99% of the time I need to use it it just locks up with the spinning icon like its trying to connect or it gives some bogus error of too many close attempts. This one is best when all the doors are already closed and you're trying to open them. Worst \"connected home\" product I own by far. Add support for Echo Please add support for echo Works Works as advertised but kinda pain to set it up. I’d recommend using a computer and not your phone Not very reliable The units that install on the garage door are not very durable or reliable. Have had to change at least twice and now down again so  im giving up. Chamberlain MyQ great! I have had the MyQ unit for several years now I inadvertently got it when I had to replace an older burned out unit at a house I purchased.  I loved it so much, I brought it with me when I moved.  Reliable, helpful and gives me peace of mind.  Thanks Chamberlain! Use to work with echo Now it doesn't MyQ (Raynor, Dixon IL - Todd N.) Garage door opener works great \nQuiet compared to my older model Chamberlain and the MyQ app works seamlessly. Thanks. Issues with app 1) The application was designed to prompt the user for a username and password at startup. If you accidentally bump the screen, the login information is lost and you have to key it back in.  It is easy to clear this information and I don’t know why this login information was not put on a separate screen.\n\n2) Sometimes the app times out and gives a network error for no reason.  When this happens, If I stand still, close the app and restart it, something is reset and the app will open or close the garage door as expected.\n\n3) The developer(s) don’t seem to be interested in replying back about the problems that I have reported to them involving especially that startup login screen issue. Love this app! This app is perfect!!! Thanks for creating this app!! Latest update messed up I generally don't update the apps, but I made a mistake on updating this app and the user interface is full of bugs. It sends false alerts, shows me as battery low and doesn't do anything now.\n\nThey didn't do simple testing before releasing the app update. Alerts don’t work They used to, now they don’t Works pretty good... Works pretty good but it would be super useful if I could set up a temporary access code for the remote keypad through this app...just a thought Freezes Works about half the time. Other half it sits and spins. Request The garage door app control is finally working fine after changing the cell battery in the door sensor. Can you add a low battery alert to app? Can you add auto garage door close after X amount of minutes using scrolling numbers to set the time till close? With that, a reminder option that door will be closing in 2-minutes reminder. Can you add a push notification reminder that the garage door is open after X amount of time maybe like 5, 10, or 15 minutes depending on user selection? More Alert customizations I’m satisfied with this product and functionalities. However, there’s room for improvement. For instance, on numerous occasions, I’ve left my garage door open all day unknowingly. I’ve left it open all day while at work and other instances either moving stuffs back and fort the garage etc... I think it will be good if further movement customizations could be built in. So say, I could enable an alert that will prompt me if my garage has been opened for 1hr, 2hrs, 5 hrs etc.\nThanks for this product!!! One star Sometimes it’s work crazy Doors out of sync Not sure why but doors seem to get out of sync. Have alerts set up and will get one after we leave home. Will then actually open the door when it is giving me a false alarm open.  Not fun. Was interested to see the home bridge product but this functionality should have been in v1. 1 feature missing This app is great. Does what it's supposed to do dependably, however, if there could be a minor GUI update, it would be perfect. I just want the ability to change the order of my garage doors. When I get home and I want to open my left side door, I have to click the door on the right in my app. I'm sure this has to do with the order that I originally set them up in but it would be nice if the app would have a way to drag and drop them in a different order. It's a minor thing so I still give it 5 stars cause it's still a great app. Just giving a small suggestion incase the developers are listening. Closed System - No Alexa integration Unfortunately No integration with Alexa or any plans to support. Error I have an uncoded error that happens randomly.  It says too many attempts and won’t close or open till later that day. Open/Close needs to ask for confirmation Operating remotely is an awesome feature but accidental taps can happen.  The app should ask the user to confirm that s/he really wants to open/close the garage.  As simple msgbox that asks “Are you sure you want to open (close)?” would suffice.  Entering password to confirm is too cumbersome.  Face ID confirmation is too easy.\n\nAlso, the beeping alert when closing is a pain in the butt.  How many garage door openers don’t have sensors by the door?  Exactly, none.  At least give the user the option to disable. Works great! Installed the myq garage door opener and app and they both work great! Very poor instructions The instructions are among the most difficult I’ve used. There is no phone support Password failure After the last update the app will not recognize my password. The website still works though. Please fix.\n\nStill not recognizing my password for the app................ Multiple user capability It would be great if there could be multiple users for the same device. Working now It was simple to connect to the single garage door but a pain to connect to my double door, it kept timing out.  At this point I’d say my smart house is brilliant so with all of the programming I have done I am confident it wasn’t me doing something wrong.\n\nThe app is very cluttered to me, I deleted my other linked devices to clean it up some. \n\nSuggestions:\n\nAllow us to select the icon for the door. I have a three car garage, one is a single and one is a double yet the only icon I can select is a single garage door.  It would make it easier those of us over 40 that require reading glasses.  You could have a single door, a double door or a house showing a three car garage with single left and right configurations as well as two single doors and two double doors for other common configurations.  That way we can just tap on the side we want opened. \n\nMy August lock is super easy to read, green circle means unlocked and red circle means locked. You could change the color of the icon with the status.\n\nIf you are Apple HomeKit compatible where is the QR code on my box or in my quick set up guide?  My other stuff was so easy to integrate. \n\nAnd why two apps?  LiftMaster and Chamberlain, you are all the same company, I know I’ve been to your Elmhurst office. Just call it MyQ Garage and you are all set. Sadly Disappointed We purchased this particular name brand and model for the app and wifi function. Sadly to find out that the physical operation works just dandy but not the app. It constantly loses connection so I don't get proper reports, I can't operate it remotely nor can I clear the history. Went to the website but no solutions to be found. The app itself doesn't have a way to reset or restore it. Not offered on the website either. Won't recommend it any longer. Straight Forward Works as designed reliably. Simple and clean. Shows states of doors, actuates without noticeable delay. Would be nice to remote control the lights. Latest update fails 75% of the time forcing me to get out of my car and manually close the door They need another update, as the latest one fails consistently. Sure, when it works, it's great. Opening the door almost always works. It's closing the door that I get errors. Says \"too many failed close attempts\" even though I haven't even tried closing it yet. Fix your bugs, Chamberlain. Great app! Is is surprisingly easy to use. \nI wasn’t sure how much I like it, but it is really worked well. \n\nNice to know for sure the garage door is closed after you leave, or if somebody opens it up during the day to get the alert. Bug ridden and unreliable Overpriced device that doesn’t work half the time. The app is extremely confusing and crashes all the time. Don’t waste your time or money. Home owner Nice stuff Great App Well designed and functional App. It does everything it is supposed to do, without hiccups! Frequent ‘MyQ Server not responding’. Great when it works but frequently get “Server Error MyQ Server not responding. Please try again later.” Leaves you locked out or waiting around wasting time trying get it to connect to close. New GDO Greatest technology for the new app and WiFi GDO. Your engineers are amazing especially Jeremy Jenkins Good but glitches Great app and device but too many false alerts especially when windy. If you need to turn off the alerts it defeats the purpose. Add ceiling fan photo Should include additional photos of devices that can be controlled by using this app.  For example, you can use this app to turn on other devices such a ceiling fan.  It would be nice to be able to chose photos other than a light bulb and a garage door.  Please include other photos.  Again, such as a ceiling fan.\n\nLarry Must Have!!! We have had this for several years now and LOVE it! Wish we bought it sooner. No more kids forgetting to close the garage or giving out the code. Need something in the house while out of town? Open the door remotely to let someone in. It is worth it! I am NOT paid to review and hardly review things but this was worth it! Horrible service Horrible service Hate it. The MyQ was great when we first set it up. But recently we keep get locked out of it. We get a code that says the door must be operated locally. The first time this happened I couldn't find any info on this problem online so I called there tech support. It sounded like I woke the guy up. Their tech support was very subpar the guy finally told me I had to uninstall the app then reinstall it. This did work after setting it back up. But everyone in my company had to do that and it keeps reoccurring. I would definitely check other options before by the MyQ. Does not work and customer service is horrible Horrible customer service Great App After over a year, nothing better. Great app This app is simple but works consistently every day. Confusing Confusing setup It works .. barely About the only thing that can be said for this is app is that it mostly works .. just. But it seems to have been designed by people who had never heard of the concept of customer testing.\n\nFirst, you have to create an account (sigh). And we all know what THAT means from a security standpoint. I’m just waiting for the “we had all N million accounts stolen” email.\n\nNext, anyone who wants to control (say) a garage door from the app must logon to that account. Yes, that’s right, there is NO ability to allow access by family members. Because, of course, no-one has children or partners, right? So you have to share the account credentials with family members. Oh yes, and they promised to fix this .. a year ago. Still waiting.\n\nOh, and you ALWAYS have to go through the account logon screen when you start the app. Even if it has remembered your credentials. Why?\n\nNow for the Apple Watch app, which is hilarious. You open the Apple Watch app, which then sits waiting for you to use the iPhone app to logon to your account .. after which you can go BACK to the Watch app to open or close the garage door. But of course, since you are forced to open the iPhone app (where you can open the garage door), what, precisely, do you save using the Watch app???\n\nWhat a sad mess. Fantastic If I forget to close the garage, I can check it and close it from anywhere Push notifications VERY unreliable The email notifications work every time but push notifications do not seem to be working anymore. Complicated and inoperable I have spent over 2 hours programming the myq garage door opener. And it doesn’t open or close the garage door.  It is really a piece of junk Nice product Instruction and programming the hub could be a little bit easier and also need that feature where I am pulling up in my car and the door open self to take out the Cell Phone hit the button takes too long Should be an update Wi-Fi option Excellent app does everything that I want it to except for one thing if you change your router you have to reprogram the whole thing should be an option to update the Wi-Fi password B970 opener and myQ Love it!  App is great. Opener is Crazy quite, good instruction manual for install. Installed it myself. Lots of features. Worth the higher price if you care about features like built in WiFi, battery backup, motion detection for lights, much more Learning curve isn’t intuitive I have years of satisfaction with Chamberlain garage openers. When I experienced a recent gear disintegration- I saw that as the opportunity to upgrade to the new WiFi equipment. I’m still trying to connect the gateway device and find the waiting time using Customer Support (3x of 10 min. plus) to be ridiculous.\n\nI continue to look forward to having everything work as advertised, and fully expect they will. But between their instructions (down MyQ app) and things not syncing up- I do have an hour+ of frustration. Maybe I’m the only one so please read other reviews. Buggy! Used to work great. Latest version gives me a too many attempts to close error when I never even had the app open! I use wall button to open the garage on the way out. Get in my car, open the app. Only then to discover I have to get back out to use the keypad because the error is showing on the app. Terrible experience. Fix it. Best garage opener with wireless adapter This app works perfect for my needs. Alerts me when the door is open or closed and how long it’s been closed. Has failed me yet! I would give it 10 stars if I could! Easy & safe This product is easy to use and the app makes it amazing. I love that I can check if the garage is open from across town, how long it’s been open, and also close it. Constant Errors This app is incredibly unreliable. If you happen to leave the app open after opening the door and access it later when you’re not near the door, you’ll get an error message. With this latest release, I’m constantly getting an error message and having to reset the door manually. I might as well just have a door opener instead of this app. Not worth it. Worst setup ever No instructions crappy setup inconsistent directions. Hate it. Easy to use Never to worry to have access. Easy and reliable. Needs multi-user functionality Now that we’ve installed the opener and the app, we’ve found that the product can only be registered to one user. So we have to all log in with the same user information/email address. The company issued a press release in 2017 stating that the account holder could assign 2 other users on the account who could log in with their own credentials. This is not yet functional. Totally unacceptable! Furthermore, it should not be limited to 3 users. We are a family of 5 and it would be nice if we could all use the app independently. Chamberlain openers Awesome product Great Technology Been using it for 3 years. Easy install and very reliable. Can't change email on account And other shortcomings. Sooo easy I can’t believe how easy it was to install and set up MyQ. Works awesome! Pay for google home and IFTTT??? You need to pay in order to use this app and product with google home and IFTTT. That’s just crazy and not very SMART. SIMPLY THE BEST!! Owned 1 year and it is amazing! Thanks Chamberlain! Needs A Confirm Button You certainly have to be careful utilizing this app.  Any slight of the hand will have your garage door open for all to see. It is a great app and very very useful however, it would be nice to have a “CONFIRM” button to validate or insure that any button depression/ selection was an intended one. Garage Door withMq app I had to go on Utube to get clear directions on how to install the garage door opener information. I’m not real good with some technology, but this app didn’t take you from one page to the next page easily. Quit and convenient Very quit and very nice will app for your phone , can tell if garage door is open or closed from anywhere you have service!! Crap Doesn’t work.. won’t program. Pay for premium so it works with google? Just the stand alone app its great and very good addition to your standard garage door opener, easy to set up and easy to use, the only and very important down of this home automation accessory is that you have to pay their premium service subscription so google home ittf et. can talk to the app. Other than that very good idea. Single user You can have one user and have share your password with everyone. NOT very Apple Like Edit: called their support twice... both times I get put on some escalation list and have to wait five days to randomly get a call back. Sad. \n\nAll I wanted was a simple HomeKit accessory to open and close my garage door... Bought this opener after waiting and waiting for them to release the HomeKit enabled version... Then, after it finally was released, I find out it’s two different and separate hubs... I guess one to talk to the opener and one to talk to HomeKit??? Anyway... instead of working “within HomeKit” like they Tech CSR said it would, one still must create an account and upload data to a third party server before you can even set it up. \n\nI LOVE the “minimalist” Apple Way... \n... but this solution is far from it. \n\nI’ll keep it for now, or until a better solution is released, and will update my rating in the future... maybe. Okay product Had weird account issues and device issues after power failure Let me use it The app immediately started asking for a rating. Please let me use it first! Latest update Your latest update has completely messed things up to where it does not send me notifications on when the garage door opens and closes and won’t let me remotely access the garage door unless I’m on Wi-Fi Peace of mind Instructions are really hard to understand but once you get it figured out, this is the best investment. It notified me when the garage has been left open for 5 min and I can close it from my phone! It will not program the remote using chamberlain opener Fails to program Formula I garage door opener. Worst instructions ever I have installed every home automation gadget ever with no problems, but this takes the cake for worst instructions and horrific user interface in the history of the world. Awful. Awesome app Love the app and how it integrates with the garage door opener. Garage door opener Instead by trained technician. Malfunctioning and give error code. Works only once in five time-a real waste of time. Too complex - but works It works but process is too complex Love It! Best thing that ever happened to my garage door. Will probably return Garage door keeps opening on its own. Needs updated directions I needed to remove an account and add an old one. The directions to remove the account were incorrect causing a lot of unnecessary frustration. We eventually figured it out but a simple fix would go a long way. Not as smooth as I had hoped Didn’t work after first try says I need to reset as to to many failed attempts. Quality app, but why no widget??? This is a reliable app that I am mostly happy with. I just don’t understand why there is no ability to make widgets. All I want to do is slide over to the widget screen and click a button to open/close the garage door, just like I do with turning on/off my Hue lights. It is just so convenient. Please add this feature. Really really needs option to create shortcut Once you get it figured out, it works pretty well. But what it really really really needs is the option to create a “shortcut” button for different places or things it controls that you can put on your main iPhone screen. It should allow me to open or close my garage door by pressing that, without having to open the app, authenticate, and then select to open the garage. It would be even better if the icon could indicate the status, open or closed in my garage door example. Love it so far! Had it for about a week now. Easy to install. Working great. Quit working This app just stopped working, updates done, nothing helps. This update breaks HOME app functionality Iphone X Myq garage door link to google home Everything says you can link..... nothing says there is a fee.... not cool MyQ Easy as pie Even with the iOS apple supliment , piece of cake to install !  I did 4 in 45 minutes .. no problem and works without a hitch Dumbest thing ever Not only you need a thousand steps in order to sign up for an account but programing the Wi-Fi hub is the dumbest thing ever: it will operate the garage door just fine during the programing and then the app will say that the process has been unsuccessful. Should have believed the bad reviews. Great app My family and I love it, we use it a couple times a day! Great! So easy to use, set up, and extremely handy! App would not detect hub I tried many times to get the app to connect to the hub.  I had to connect to hub’s web page through the temporary WiFi and configure it. Poor Installation Instructions The package arrived at my doorstep yesterday, I couldn’t wait to install it.  I began following the instructions step by step. I setup the account and login as well as the password. So I got it to connect to my WiFi and began adding the device so I added my garage door and pressed the learn button on my opener. So it opened my door then closed my door and the app stated the process had failed to register. I tried it again. Same problem failed to register. I then tried it using my wife’s iPhone but no luck with that either. I had to call technical support. After waiting ten minutes to get a human voice to answer. He began walking me thru the process but we came across the same problem failed to register. I he then told me to press the number 1 button on the back of the hub. Then right after pressing 1 he had me press the test button on the sensor. Once we did that the device completed the setup. Whew what a pain the instructions are very poor and needs a technical person to rewrite them. Thanks to tech support my garage door can be opened remotely now. Not dependable Works sometimes and then not at all. App suggestion I love the app!  I would like to see an option to set an alert/push notification if the garage door has been left open for certain duration which is defined by the user. Lied about HomeKit compatibility I bought this because it was advertised as being HomeKit compatible. They have done nothing but constantly say it's coming soon. Well over year later and never added feature.\n\nNow that the feature is added they expect us to buy another part to make it work False alerts with latest version I've had this app for almost 2 years now and it's always been great. Suddenly, since the last update about a week ago, I'm getting a lot of false alerts. I have alerts set up for when my door opens and when it remains open for 10 minutes. \n\nSince the latest update I'm getting 2 open alerts back-to-back. Sometimes they are within seconds of each other and sometimes they can be 3 - 5 minutes apart. I'm also getting erroneous \"door has remained open\" alerts even though the door had been closed a few minutes earlier. Completely satisfied. 5 stars!!! Never fails. I know exactly when my doors opens/closes. The remote function works perfectly. I am a completely satisfied customer.\n\nWith every penny. MyQ It has been one of the best and most reliable I have used it connects always told me when the garage doors are open. Mother in Laws This so far has been very handy, my mother in law’s memory is getting worse and it’s very nice to be able to check and see if door is closed and also assist to open if necessary. So far huge fan, great product!!! Thank you!! Nice! Great app! Inconsistent This app/system is unreliable. In addition, there’s no easily accessible number to call to get help diagnosing problems. Once you encounter a problem, there’s no way to recover unless your home which obviously if your home, you don’t need this app/system. My setting gone after app updated to 3.93.3 My setting disappeared after the app updated to 3.93.3. I cannot see my garage door icon from the app.\nI am using iPhone 6 with the latest iOS version. The app was working fine for the past year except this update. Suggestion If u guys copartner with kuna app\nWill be appreciated This opener.... There is no speed control. I will never buy another one of these openers ever. MyQ is so easy to setup. Why did I ever wait for 2 years to set it up! Great Peace of mind I use this in combination with my security cameras and it gives me that peace of mind to be able to check and see if I forgot to close the garage on my way out.\n\nOver 1 year so far and no problems. My neighbor texted me in San Diego all the way from Tampa Florida where my house is to let me know my son left the garage door open. Whew, so I thanked him and closed it from my present location (way out on the East Coast). The system also recorded the length of time the garage was open (5 hours)... Unreliable I get a lot of spinning circle when trying to open or close the door. Not awesome It's great, when it works I love the idea of using my phone to open my garage door. This tool is great, when it works. More than 60% of the time it doesn't work. If the bugs are worked out, I will give a better rating. Recommended We enjoy technology and this garage opener and the app makes it much easier for us ! Great Products I love my IQ! Whisper Wi go never works even if you buy the “gateway “, maybe if you hang the router by the motor it will...\nI got the 1- 3/4 motor and is way slower than my old 1/2.\nOnly good thing is super quiet! Garage Door Great service. Called came next day and did an awesome job. This is our second time and we will have him replace our garage door. Highly recommended!! Quit asking and integrate with Siri. Asks for a review EVERY time you attempt to use until you finally give in.  Hence ones star. \n\nAlso, should work with Siri.   “Hey Siri, open the garage door” instead of open app, enter password even though you enabled TouchId on setup, then be asked to send review, then pick a place, then click on the garage door. Ok. But not secure enough to trust it completely The garage door sensor keeps loosing connection. I have a timer setup to close door every night at midnight. If the sensor malfunctions, like it has several times.   The garage door opens. This is not acceptable security. So convenient I didn’t know just how much I would use this remote app. \n\nIt really saved me a few times from driving hours back home. Rouben O Very great and high quality product, \nWorks well and I love it \nI would recommended very highly Great App! I love this App!  It works great and I really appreciate knowing when someone has opened my garage door when I’m away from home. It also allows me to close it from anywhere whenever a family member has accidentally left it open. Wow! Really impressed with how far this app has come! Keep up the good work Good app but old version was better This app instead of adding features I feel like they are removing them.  Not that I used it often but it says supports iwatch which it used to.  I was able to open, close and see if the garage doors were open and closed on the iwatch all of a sudden this feature is gone no app for iwatch anymore.   The app itself still says offers iwatch but that’s false.  Please update and add that feature back.  Thank you Great app! I used it all the time to open and close the garage door when workers come by. \n\nWould be amazing if the app would have CarPlay support. That way I could open my garage from the screen in my suv. Great app Great app for checking on Garage door.  No longer have to call friend to check to see if I left door open.  Also great to let a friend in house without giving them a key or garage door code. No alerts Since the update, I no longer receive alerts when garage opens and closes. Great! My unit used to be Great! But since this update it doesn’t work Great App Glad I bought a garage door opener with Q technology. Chamberlain garage door remote access Garage door doesn’t always work only part of the time remotely disappointed in the ability but it doesn’t respond. Love it! I love the accessibility of the app. I’ve had to use it remotely several times to let people in my house to either drop stuff off or pick stuff up. Also when I’ve had that nagging feeling of leaving it open after I’ve left in a hurry. It’s been very convenient for us! Plus, their customer service has been great. Our door stopped working because the little panel inside went out. They shipped it in record time and we’re up and running again! Works Great We love our garage door opener and the app! It is nice to get an alert each, and everytime the door is opened! Love the features of this app I can take a walk or bike ride without worrying about bringing the remote for the garage door. I can also set it to notify me of the door is opened or closed. Best part is that I can set a time that the garage door will be closed if it was inadvertently left open. Convenience. Convenience. Convenience. Great app Thanks for making life easier Awesome App Works great! Easy Easy to set up and user friendly Metal garages and Chamberlain Not terribly happy that, even with a Wink Hub 60’ from the metal garage, I will have to purchase an additional external antenna to make the garage door integrate with my Chamberlain app. Probably won’t invest in any more Chamberlain openers. Craftsman works better and cheaper if you’re not concerned with wireless connectivity Works Perfectly Has never failed in the one year I've had the system installed. Love the Apple Watch integration.\n\nPlease add Apple CarPlay support! Suggestion I love the app and have been using it for several years. We recently purchased a new Chevrolet that didn’t come with the built in garage door remote. However the vehicle does support car play. It would be great if I could add the App to car play so I could open the garage door from the screen in the car.\n\nThank you in advance for thinking about this feature. Alerts stopped working Latest update killed alerts. No longer being alerted when the garage is left open. No iPad version. Wish there was an iPad version for in wall control.   IFTTT they charge for, should be free Thanks! Fantastic app for parents that have teens that lose keys! Let them in the house safely from anywhere! $1/month for Google integration? What a rip off. $1/month just to integrate with Google assistant! What a ridiculous cash grab, no thanks. I regret purchasing a garage that doesn’t integrate with SmartThings or Google or anybody. MyQ is awful. Install instructions are so bad I had to watch several U-tube before I could get this thing to connect.  I still can’t figure out how to connect the second door No additional accounts The app is pretty great, but we only got this system because we expected to be able to have guests have temporary logins and each of us to have our own. We didn’t really want to share one login. Last update opens my garage from time to time Last update opens my garage door from time to time without me interacting with the app. \nIt's terrible since if I don't pay attention I ll end up with a garage opened. \nWhy?! Schedule not fixed After 9 months , still waiting on the schedule fix. Misrepresented capabilities of device..... buy another brand. Garage door opener Very easy to install. Directions are put together well. Easy to program Great App!!!! I love the extra security when being away from home, to just check check to make sure my garage door is closed. Get your Alexa skill working and published I purchased this to open my Chamberlain garage door opener and check the status with my Amazon echo devices. I was assured that it would work just to find out it does not. From when I found on the Internet there are great many of us that are greatly disappointed. Please fix immediately and let me know. Inaccurate Reports The app constantly says my garage door is open when in reality it is actually closed. The alert saying that it is open makes me get up and go check it, and it is always closed. I would be real mad if this were to happen when I am away from my house and have to drive all the way home to find it is actually closed. WORST UPDATE YET! STAY AWAY from this update! I have been using the app FLAWLESSLY for over a year - no complaints at all.\n\nWith this latest update, I am CONSTANTLY getting \"cannot connect to server\" error messages. Also, History is not updating.\n\nLastly, the Places main screen has ALWAYS stayed updated. I just came home a few minutes ago and the status screen says the garage door was closed over three hours ago rather than just a couple of minutes ago. It ALWAYS was up-to-date. NOT anymore!\n\nNot sure what has changed, but the app is no longer reliable and that's the whole point of the app.\n\nPlease fix! Don’t update Recent update to the app erased all the data. Now when you open up the app, it doesn’t show any previous garage doors anymore. It’s like setting up a new myQ again! Great app LOVE this app. It lets you know when the door is open or shut so you can tell whose going in and out (kids!) and you can remotely activate the garage door if you need to let someone in. Make sure you have another way to get in in case the app malfunctions, your phone etc. Buena Muy buena Don’t update The app is great but this last upgrades login button doesn’t work with the newest iOS     \n\nNeeds fixing fast Wireless garage door app This is very easy to install. You can do everything on your app from your smart phone. I use this as a security notification for my business. Well worth the money Drops connection WiFi to LTE At my house it works from my phone.  As I leave the app cannot switch to LTE cellar and hangs up.  Try closing and restarting and it takes forever to connect.  I can enter my keypad code long before the app comes on line.  Just started happening in the last couple weeks. Wireless command center One of the best add ons that can be put on a garage door, 100% worth investment Automatic remote garage door opener Received today, and installed today. So far works wonderful. Server For the last 9 months, I haven’t been able to use the app because it tells me that the app can’t connect to the server. Will this get fixed at some point? Isn’t working well with new update. After this last update the garage keeps saying to many failed attempts with a yellow ”!” Triangle. Great Product but when it doesn’t work or the app is glitched it’s a problem. works once after I plug it back in then the same message appears. Works as advertised The Chamberlain app works well and was easy to download, install and implement.  Pleased to see it works with Nest products.  Would add a star if it easily integrated with Alexa from Amazon. Not that quick Many times I have to wait until network is connected for me to be able to use this as a routine garage door opener. You line I am in Palm Beach County Florida with good cellular service and yet I have to wait anywhere up to 15 minutes until the app access is the network even though other apps are working just fine\nFor a while, the other nice issue was that there was a symbol on myApple Watch. That unfortunately, is now gone Stopped working but now back This update to support X has caused it to stop working. I tried logging in with face ID, then nothing happens. Tried to manually log in, nothing happens.\n\nUpdate\n\nLooks like may have been some server issues but it's working again. Great app Update to my original 1 star review. They’ve finally updated the aspect ratio. That was my only gripe. MyQ IYQ The home we bought had the garage opener adapter. It just plugged into our router BUT the former owners had to release the ownership of it before we could register it. \nIt has worked great! It tells us how long the door has been closed or open, it lets us open it from anywhere (that we have service) and when you use the app to close it the lights blink and a warning sound goes off before the door lowers to let anyone or a pet know that s”?& is coming down. \nThe chamberlain garage door opener is the only piece of equipment we own. How do I️ get my money back!! I don’t ever write reviews but this one I’m writing. It’s so frustrating when you purchase something and it doesn’t work like you would expect it to. This product is so inconsistent. It works maybe 15% of the time. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Can’t delete history App is mostly great except that you can’t delete the history. You can go through the process of deleting it, but after less than a minute, it’s all back again. It's June 2017 and still no support for iPhone 7+ ***Finally better resolution support and now even for the iPhone X. Thank you!!!”\n\nGuys the app is great but seriously the resolution hasn't been changed for current iPhones??? Please update the resolution!\n\n**update**\nAnother update has gone out and STILL no support for higher resolution.\n\n**UPDATE** \nSince I got a new phone “iPhone X” it asked for me to write a review “again” and well I’m gonna say the same thing. Still no resolution support for other devices. Smh what is it with the developers of this app???? Subscription on 3rd Party apps??? Really?!? I find it ridiculous that you want to charge me a monthly fee so I could ask Google to close my garage or IFTTT for that matter. That’s not how it works! Don’t update Don’t do the latest update.  The app no longer works at all. It won’t let you log in. Mr. Nel Great app. New app is great / Product has been rock solid for over a year As promised I am changing my review now that they fixed the app to have retina assets. Never had an issue with the app and now it looks really good on the retina displays. \n\nThank you for listening to your customers on this! Awesome control Works 80% of the time and has been convenient at times as well. The disappointment is I rarely get a Message displaying the open Icon showing that the garage door is open, Then when I close it ...turns out I actually opened it, … It’s confusing and risky. Simple to install & implement First time user / application - easy to setup - did require some research in order to get my two cars programmed. Very happy so far! Telephone app great! Great product Flawless operation. Had recent power outage and battery backup took over without an issue. Very pleased. Works fine. No frills For just opening and closing the doors remotely and knowing their status, the app works fine. I’m impressed that they added fingerprint recognition. Please update UI It just seems out of date. It works. But a facelift would be nice. Home kit? Why am I paying an extra $50 for a home kit hub. Lame. Should be built in, not an upcharge. Great App Easy to install. Works great! Works well for what I need. Very handy. Works every time. Didn't have a problem since day one. Works great especially when set to automatically close garage door after you leave the in case you forget to close it.\n\nNow the I can’t get the door to close. The light and warning sound comes on but the door won’t close. I have to do it manually by the wall button. 3D Touch Shortcuts Please add the ability to use the app by pressing the icon (3D Touch Shortcuts) and choosing options without having to open the app. Impressive MyQ is easy to set-up and it works well with iPhone! Very Pleased This is a simple to use App with everything needed to ensure it works as expected. Thanks Chamberlain! Excited but hesitant I have always had the fear that I have left the garage door open. I had to replace my Chamberlain garage door opener due to electrical problems from a storm. I wanted another like product. I was excited to see that Chamberlain had this product, but I was a little hesitant at what it could do. I can express my feelings in three words, “I love it”. Not only can I check to see my garage door is open from miles away, I can even open and close it for someone from a great distance. my garage overall this app has worked great with no real issues Nice app. Is very good app . Nice to have it. Thank you . Terrible app This app freezes, doesn’t load half of the time or respond, and is hit or miss on showing my linked appliances. Really hope the app improves because it’s incredibly disappointing to purchase a wi-fi garage opener only to have it work a portion of the time. Not working in IOS 11.1 My app is no longer working in IOS 11.1  it’s deleted all my information once I actually get into the app and just crashes Chamberlain products need major improvement The MyQ app is dead slow! It does not seem to remember my login credentials between sessions. It requires multiple login attempts before finally connecting. Chamberlain does not seem to respond to emailed requests for customer support. App does not always “remember”. Stays at login screen until door is cycled up and down by other means. Great Addition Love the MyQ. Makes things a lot easier. No longer works Has not worked for a while now. Have reset and reprogrammed several times, works once and quits. More compatibility It would be a 5star review if it connected to more types of hubs.\nie Cox home life, Control4, RTI, Logitech, etc. Awesome Automation By far one of the best home automation products I own. Flawless and reliable. App is very intuitive. Alerts tell me whenever a family member or potential intruder is coming or going. Get kicked out of the app My wife and I both like the roll up door opener but the app kicks us both out often. Then you have to login in again. Trouble connecting Occasionally requires me to log in, which defeats the purpose while driving No google home or Alexa No free integration with either google home and Alexa.. Too many false alarms The door sensor appears to be too sensitive. False alarms. Can only guess the wind giggles the door and triggers the sensor. Wish it was not based on a tilt mechanism but more like a standard door sensor. To many problems I have had many problems and the service department would benefit from training and providing a decent customer service. I was even very hard to order parts. Awesome app but could’ve been all in one. I love that I could give my mother the door opener and I use my phone to get the door open. The only issue I have is that I wish the garage door opener came with Apple HomeKit already included in the door opener rather than buying a separate piece. But the app works just fine. Also another issue I’m having is the Apple Watch app keeps asking me to login to my app before using it and When I do login it still doesn’t work. It keeps asking me to login and doesn’t leave that page. Is there anything I could do on my end to fix that? Does the job The app is simple to configure and use. It does seem to lose connection to the server when you try to open it too quickly after it has closed. However, aside from when I was testing it, I’ve had no problems with it. It would be nice to have a guest account feature. Works Works well. When away and I think, \"Did I close the garage door?\" Now I can easily check with this app. Charging for IFTTT integration. It is absurd to think you can charge for integrating to other apps like IFTTT. Having to pay $1 a month just to use a feature is a terrible idea.\nNobody buy this, show them we won’t stand for this kind of behavior. Works great, but ads in app disappoint This works as designed although recent software updates make the app slower to open and introduced advertisements. Now, that would be fine if I had not bought the opener but I did so why am I getting adverts. You already have my email, don’t hit me up with ads in an app that supports the product I bought. When working, it's great My only hesitation with this device came last November when the bridge acted strange and wouldn't let me log in. I reset the bridge several times and the light kept blinking. The app kept telling me there was an error. That happened on two separate occasions and persisted for about a week both times. Prior to that there were no problems. Since the second time, there have not been issues either, but that shook my confidence a bit. If not for that, it is a great app in that it tells you the current status of the garage door, and how long it's been down. There's not much more that someone would need. A running log of opening and closing would probably be the ultimate upgrade they could provide. Beyond that, there isn't anything I can think of that they could do with the system as it stands. For me, it's convenient to open my door when I'm on a walk and a few houses down, but I've yet to need to open it remotely from a distance. After the glitch I had, I'm hesitant to open it without knowing for sure I can close it. But it is really nice to check remotely to see if family members made it home for the night. It's also great to make sure the door is down without getting out of bed. If you are someone who gets halfway to your destination and forgets whether you shut the door, you can just hop on the app and check. Good but slow on email alerts I would like to see alerts as SMS text. After various tries at email accounts they are very slow to send. Delays are a problem when dealing with forgotten open door. Good but needs another app Current app works ok, they need an app for CarPlay so we can open our garage doors as we pull up to the house... Smart Garage- A must have! This easy app made installation a breeze, now I can rest assured my house is closed up. Alexa Wish Alexa could integrate with MyQ. When is this happening? Great app that can still be more My wife and I are excited about this app as are we with our new opener, however it would be great if the app could be Amazon Alexa compatible Not Happy We have been having the worst time getting our app to even let us sign in. We can’t connect and it’s been going on for more than a month. Love the remote control Tech gets better every day! Serial no print quality needs improving It looks like a D but was a 0.  Try figure out better printing or avoid using D Works well I would give it 5 stars if the app would send me a notification when the garage door is open after a designated time. Works Works as advertised!\nExcept it interferes with my normal openers. App stuck App is stuck on the first step. Hit “next” and get a the hour glass stuck Great app Great app Myq chamberlain garage opener Great product and super easy install/connect Trips off on occasion. The wifi sensor is a great security tool.  At times it trips off and must be reset.  The three times this has happened I was out of town for several days.  Reset is easy but a nuisance since I’m often away. Great system when it works. Awesome!!! Love this App. Very convenient. Convenient. Works pretty well. Sometimes forgets my login and i have to manually log in again. Otherwise works well. LOVES IT! This app is perfect. We don’t even have conventional garage door remotes anymore. Periodic not responsive There is a chord with this app which causes it to not respond when I read my garage when I am on Wi-Fi from my home. I tap the Chrysler symbol and then gives me the spinning circle. About half a mile later it will say unresponsive. Then when I clear that and hit the garage door symbol it will go down. Please work on this bug. MyQ = good, but not great Most who have tried to set up MyQ have likely encountered issues with the less than desirable instructions. Once set up, the MyQ app is a good tool, however, Chamberlain’s greed ruined the possibility of opening and closing the garage door using IFTTT with Google Home without having to pay to upgrade the service. Seriously, allowing people to use their voice instead of their fingers is worth charging an added fee? I feel sorry for the amputees that are being discriminated against. Everyone should enjoy free access to be able to open and close their garage door. Shame on Chamberlain for being greedy and charging the added fee to those seeking convenience. Wow that was easy Easy to install and setup. Plus the garage door opener is so quiet!! Worst app ever Breaks all the time. Customer service won't help. Never buy this! Chamberlain app Simple to use and Works great! Nice We have only had the door & app installed 2 days but love being able to check to see if door is closed. No more turning back around to go back to the house when I can’t remember! :D Sndjdjdndd S does not work having hard time connecting garage door opener to smarthub. Flakey and frustrating Giving Chamberlain another chance, now that they have HomeKit integration, but I’m having all kinds of trouble with the app:-( More problems than it’s worth Constantly having issues with using this on to garage doors. Love it Man I love this app and features! Anytime I forget or thought I forgot to close my garage I can simply check it out and have piece of mind that my house is secured. It is also great if you need to let someone in your place. I have had this for several years now and the only problem I have ever had is operator error when I can't remember my password to get in, works seemless. HomeKit It’s ridiculous you have to buy an accessory to make HomeKit work for openers that already have WiFi built in. To me, that sounds like more programming and money grabbing.... Garbage Wi-Fi setup process for liftmaster must've been engineered by monkeys. Utter nonsense with no clear directions on how to do something as simple as switching out a router. Try again guys or get someone that can. Update resolution Works good, needs to be updated for iPhone 7 Plus screen. The plus model phones have been out a couple years there is no reason it couldn’t have been done a long time ago Randomly drops my equipment from my account I convinced my wife to buy in to this, that this would be the cutting edge, and it just never works. \n\nI’ll have everything working fine on both doors, go to bed, wake up and both doors are no longer on my account.  I do this every couple days. \n\nCalling support is an absolute joke. One guy “chuck” said “have you tried looking at YouTube for your answer?”  Uh... \n\nThe next guy “gabe” just gave up and said “give  up for now and give it more time for our software guys to get it right”... \n\nSimply unacceptable. Very limited Loses connection every time the network changes. \nNeeds CarPlay and 3D Touch support. Great App This is a great app. Say you are having something delivered and you can’t be home but don’t want it to sit out all day. You can have the delivery company contact you and you can open the garage door for them - no code to give out. It can alert you when the door opens and closes - now you know if the kids are playing around with it. In a rush to get to work and then think “did I remember to close the garage door?” This app verifies that. \nWonderful peace of mind and ease of convenience! Garage opener Valery in your customer service dept. is one of the best reps your company could possibly want. She has gone the extra mile for me, and retained the smile in her voice. Give her a raise she deserves it! Home Bridge - My Q - chamberlain app The Chamberlain App is working as expected. So far so good. I’ve linked my opener with homekit. Soon I will attempt a second opener. It’s great having the notifications coming through my IPhone. Functional but lacks polish One major problem with the user interface: when you touch the garage icon, the door operates immediately! A mechanical activation like this needs a confirmation for safety. In addition, initial setup was balky. When finally set up, works well. Conn Keeps losing password then locking me out too quickly.  Integrate fingerprint and stop this password madness. Not always on line Not sure. 3 times out of 10 the app shows the garage door off line.   Even closing the app and reopening does not clear the issue. This happens mostly on closing the door. Hoping for an update soon. App Very nice app Doesn’t perform the task I bought it to do. Advertised to perform on a schedule and it doesn’t. I want to program door to close at night in case I forget but app fails when you setup a schedule. Complete waste of $100+. Very difficult tried my patience Very very difficult I just kept fidgeting with it till it finally got it, tried many different things Incorrect steps for MyQ Home Bridge setup The app is okay for use but the setup steps for adding a MyQ Home Bridge are wrong. During the step to press the #2 button to transfer settings from the MyQ Smart Garage, the correct button to press is actually #1. I spent hours trying to set up the MyQ Home Bridge unsuccessfully and had to reconfigure my MyQ Smart Garage twice; which requires shutting off my Wi-Fi network for it to reset properly. Please update this app to have the proper steps to avoid other customers from going through the time consuming process of frustration. Buggy Took several hours to get this working. Support on the web is terrible App doesn’t always work Either the app doesn’t work or the garage door doesn’t open. Great concept if it worked correctly. Home Kit missing I can not find the home kit options or any documentation on how to add my door openers to my home kit. This app looks outdated and feels cheap. Where do you get off charging me to use other free services?? I get it you probably have to offset the cost of your AWS servers but still it’s a little annoying when you charge for free OPEN SOURCE products and can’t help users by publishing the documentation needed! Good app Works well! Nice to close and open the garage door with the phone. Important New Option I really would like an option to turn on an alert when my door had been open longer than X amount of time. \n\nMost of the time the door is left open is I've forgotten it was open. Horrible instructions for iOS setup and HomeKit IOS support was an afterthought for Chamberlain.  The setup booklets aren’t very helpful for IOS and all of the info on the Chamberlain website tells users to go to Apple.com for anything related to HomeKit.  Lame.  It isn’t straightforward to add the Chamberlain MyQ Home Bridge to HomeKit.  The least they can do is tell you how.  Can’t get it to work with HomeKit. Awesomeness This is an awesome product.  Works great every time.  Saved me plenty of times with working with my Apple Watch.  I can get in my garage with it. Great Purchase Love this safety feature. Totally recommend. Chamberlain APP I like the Garage Door opener. With the ability to open the garage from any location.  \n\nIf your not sure if you closed the Garage door you just bring up the app and check. \n\nKids get home before you no problem! With the ability to open and close. Pernsteiner Super convenient Garage Door This door opens when we're not home, the app doesn't allow door to close minutes after door is open. Getting a replacement through HomeDepot, this whole opener is defective, door wouldn't close and nothing blocking sensors. Erases Stored Settings Download this app if you like the challenge of resetting all your information.  Once again I updated the app as recommended and it wiped out my garage door settings.  Nice feeling when you are not at home and need to control your doors.  Thank you Chamberlain! The only company that is putting a pay up They require you to pay a monthly or yearly subscription to work with google home and another subscription to work with ifttt. Worst company to enter the smart things market. Excellent Know when door is opened, can open for housekeeper or contractor via mobile.... Excellent! Motion detector light comes on when i enter garage from house, & have door set to the minimum of 5 minutes before it closes in case i forget to close. Excellent product! Good, could be great Overall the app is fine and simple to use. Once in a while there's a hiccup with the hardware saying the garage door has opened when it truly hasn't. That makes it hard to trust it 100%. It's still a must have.\n10/12/17 now it has too many issues where it just won’t close or false open/close. Works better than expected ...only a single \"hang\" since installing the app last year. Clean interface, multiple devices...it's truly indispensable and reliable beyond expectations. Really Impressive Opener I looked for a couple hours on line with the Home Depot and Lowe’s web sites and decided on the Chamberlain HD950F opener. Installed myself in 4.5 hours. That included programming the cars, remotes, wall unit, and the phone. Super quite and the app is really easy to use. Very impressed with everything. Apple like quality Easy to install, it just works. Bravo! One feature missing and it’ll be perfect Everything with the chamberlain has been good. I just wish they would have an option for auto close in a given time. There’s no option to set auto close in the app. Garevr Work perfectly\nBest choice \nWorth the money \nA+++++ Door Opened Continuously! I had to remove the pad from the wall because the door was opening erroneously. It’s a good thing my neighbor was going to the store or I could have been here with the garage door open all night. I read other reviews that mentioned similar events. I’m very disappointed and hope that Chamberlain will work out these glitches! Great Great app schedule is notworking Can't save schedule Novelty Item Had for nearly a year, works when I want to ‘show it off’. Not dependable when I ‘need’ it. Also, phantom operation is a real issue. We believe we have fixed ours, but still makes me uneasy knowing my door may function unwittingly. Has Apple Watch functionality, but won’t work unless your phone is unlocked so not much use there. Does not integrate with other home applications and some very stupid features Chamberlin is really behind the curve with other products that are much more integrated with things like Alexa, Google, Apple HomeKit etc. They then have the nerve to charge you $12 a year to have it integrate with IFTTT. Now they want to sell a $50 Apple HomeKit hub, which is not their fault, but still a pain. The application supposedly links with Nest but it is a joke as nest already has its own app and they need you to manually use this app to open or close your garage\nDoor and then swipe to the nest icons and then manually turn off or on your nest thermostats or set them to home or away manually. LOL. That is not automation and no integration whatsoever. Very funny and very misleading. Until they get their game together with integration go with one of the other brands Works great! Simple and effective. Open the app. Tap the garage icon and the door opens when closed or closes when open Does one function really well. Not updated for bigger iPhone screens This app lets you control things (off/on and up/down) and notifies you of such but it hasn’t been updated since iPhone 5 for screen size. That is annoying and denotes a lack of attention to detail or care. \n\nIs there a reason you guys haven’t updated it? Nousy door Motor is significantly noisier 1 yr after purchase. Great product Works perfect with my MyQ enabled garage. Recent failures Works great when it works. I had to reprogram it 4 times in the last month. Easy setup, mostly reliable Nearly always reliable, which is an issue, since you’re left wondering if the notifications are accurate. At one point I was getting notified of openings while at work. That’s stopped, but now it tells me that I’m leaving the door open after I drive away, which isn’t true. Seems to have started after iOS 11, but not sure. We’ll see what happens with future updates. Needs customizable notifications also. No Lock for iPhone App? It does connect to the garage so that’s fine. I wish there were more options in the app. Like, “Lock the garage unless I use a password from inside the app.” That way, if I’m out of town, i can hard lock the whole system. This was important to me and I’m sad it wasn’t included. I’ll give more stars if you include more robust features. It's okay but why not make it really smart? Ok, pretty cool.  I can sit a home and push the app button to open and close my garage door.  I can even do this from the coffee shop (not sure of the reason).\n\nWhy not make this app into something useful?\n- alarm me when the door doesn't close because of the sensors activating it (left a shovel under the door)\n- automatically open the door when my phone comes back into wifi range (you know...I'm home again)\n- alert me when the door is open at a custom time range and provide the option to auto shut the door (in case I go to bed and forgot to shut it)\n- give me the option to fully lockout anyone entering the garage at a custom time range (like when I'm in bed)...alert me if someone tries to enter.\n- let me program when the light come on/off\n- let me remotely set a temporary passcode for entry\n- Track how many times my door has opened and closed and provide me with maintenance recommendations...maybe even tie into a service that automatically comes out to lubricate/adjust springs/alignment/service opener\n\nYou could make this into something that is really useful...right now it is something that is just really expensive.  Nice part about it is that  all you have to do is program the app and update it...oh yeah and decide to do it.  Hey, maybe I should be the product manager for this product now! Amazing My family has never been more safe . \nEveryone knows when the the garage is opened and closed. \n\nThank you Love the app Works great and is awesome for deliveries where I’m not home! Crap Worked for a week and then quit working not worth the money don’t bother buying the app is also not working Hate how I had to rate it You are prompted non stop to rate the app.  It is a terrible app as a result. Rbdorris A little tricky to set up .link emails slow to come to in box.But works fine so far. App resolution stuck in 2012 Great app! It does what it needs to do. But can we please update the resolutions to iPhone 8 and 8+ sizes. It’s been 3 years with these new resolutions and Chamberlain is still rocking iPhone 5 screen sizes. And with the iPhone X on the horizon these boys should get with the program. Best neighbor ever Before we had an app that reminded us we left the garage door open, our poor neighbor had to call all of the time!  And I don’t have to get out of bed to close the forgotten door! Number 1 of all garage door openers The best. Awesome app!!! Love being able to control and see the door status from afar.\n\nAwesome opener but he app seems to have become unstable with its recent updates. For my door open or door closed notifications I used to get one notification with the time. Now I get several repeat notifications with the same time stamp. I’ve gotten as many at 12 door just opened notifications with the same time stamp. Same for door closed notifications. Some times only two or three notifications but rarely just one. :( Security liability The app is a big toggle button. A butt dial sort of inadvertent touch will unknowingly reopen your garage after you drive away. Lies and horrible customer service I expected HomeKit support, it was written on the box. Watched forums but didn’t make an account. Now others get it free but a feature advertised when I bought it, I’m now expected to pay for it Latest Update Messed Everything Up Happy for updates but the latest caused the sensors to mess up making it useless until I could get to that house and hopefully fix it. Part timer The myQ only works when it wants to, the signal is very strong! Not to happy!!!!! Loses login info on update Loses login info in update.  Such a pain Reliable Never had a problem with this system. I have been able to open and close my garage from anywhere I have traveled so far Bad app This app doesn’t work properly. If you opening a garage door from app and someone calling you at the same time, app just stopped working and you stuck. Or Neigborh has opener using the same frequency like your garage door opener then your garage door will be opened without your knowledge. Bad! Bad! Bad! Works great As title says. Works great. I will have one of these on all garage doors I own Needs update to Schedules Update-\nAdded IFTTT for $10/year subscription... ridiculous! I’m ready to leave MyQ and find something else... almost all other smart home products work with IFTTT for free! I already gave you money for the products. \n\nUntil they either update their scheduling or allow IFTTT/Smartthings for free, they are still getting 1 Star.  \n\n——\nSchedules need updating- addition of items like run on sunset or sunrise for the lighting items would be great! \n\nIntegration into IFTTT or Smartthings would also be great. Range limited The range to the WiFi hub is limited to 15ft in my case. I have to go to the front door to get a connection and the hub is in the coat closet! Great app Had this for awhile it does wonders, was in Alabama on vacation and My Son went in and opened door and it told me in a push message it opened and closed,👌👍👌👍 Super quiet Love the WiFi. Very quiet. Will buy more. If it would only remember me when I check the box... Works great after I’m logged in.  Course I have to log in every time with email etc...   easier to unlock the side door. Old Pullman Garage Set this thing up on my 1920s garage that is still surviving. Has worked wonders. FYI: clean base of door once in a while from debris. 💪❤️👍 On the fritz I’ve enjoyed the app until recently. The app now alerts me to a closed door every two minutes. In fact I can’t write this review without interruption of another closed door! Best ap ever This is by far one of the most useful apps I have!!! at home only problem is that the door wants to not close and open back up! MyQ garage door opener Works great, loses sync once in a while, but easy fix. Too much ads Too much adds Can't schedule auto close The 1 feature I want it to do, it won't.  It won't auto close doors left open at a set time. Arse wipes Best garage door opener and app! Best garage door opener and app!  My neighbors are jealous.  I can open the garage anytime -  I don’t need an opener - I can use my phone.  If it’s raining it can be opened before you get out of the car.  If you are not sure you closed it you can check it anytime.  So smart. Carin Love this product.  No more guessing about whether the garage door is closed.  Simple to set up.  Easy to use.  Recommend highly. Garage Door Convenience It is such a convenience to open the door upon arriving at the house.  Also it's great to open the door on occasion when a workman arrives when no one is home yet so he can get started without waiting.  I love it! Worse than not having I bought this system hoping to never get to work and have to wonder if I left the garage door open. Unfortunately, this thing throws so many false positives that it is worse than not having it. Is it better to wonder if I forgot to close the door or to receive an email that I left it open when I didn't? Horrible Connectivity It works very inconsistently and tech support is nowhere.\n\nStop the Pop-ups when I’m trying to use it! Works fine but it's too large The app works as advertised, but there's no reason for such a simple app to use 130 MB of memory. The app to run my TiVo is only 30 MB. Awesome opener I've had 2 craftsman openers (and they were not bad), but I love my Chamberlain. You ever got to work and wondered \"Did I close the door?\" Well no need to worry again. You can check from your phone. Integration Needs integration with Amazon Echo Useless app with new iOS Since I can’t use this app with the new iOS (driving feature enabled prevents launching of apps) and as an added bonus, model B550 requires a compatibility bridge to work with my vehicle. Overall, I’d say this chamberlain model B550 and the app both are a POS. Very reliable I think the app has been great and very stable. Best product ever. Best product ever. Chamberlain works like champ Easy to install and I was able to link to wink hub network. Garage Like the fact that I have control of my garage door from anywhere. Unable to pair with iPhone Unable to pair garage with iphone iOS 11 issues Not working on iPhone 6S on iOS 11.0.1. Also pretty annoying that the app is not native resolution. Hire some competent developers please. Added features I would like to have a feature that sends notifications about garage being open to long Chamberlain Outstanding. Works great. I love I got it A lifesaver Great when your kids beat you home. I know when they walk in the door. Continuous false positives 2-3x a day the app reports the garage has been opened when in fact it has not.\n\nSeriously the worst hardware app combo ever Needs to update to new SDK App works fine, it’s just using an ancient SDK. Also annoying that every other time you open the app it wants you to rate it with no option for never. Door order issue I have two doors side by side. Visually it would make sense to have them match their position in the app. Is that possible? Believe it or not it isn’t! I commented on this quite a while ago and it still hasn’t been fixed. So many apps have basic ordering methods, this isn’t rocket science. Please fix! Love my Chamberlain! The wireless garage door opener is wonderful. It is so nice to be able to open and close my garage door remotely as well as seeing when somebody else has opened it. It has worked perfectly since installation two years ago. My Q Garage I had the chain driven garage opener, then it broke. This allowed me to upgrade to the “quiet” belt driven garage opener. When I upgraded some nice new features came with the garage opener. 1.  Wall remote opener for outside the garage, this can be programmed for guess, 2 car remotes, motion sensor for garage light, IOS app that allows you to open the garage door from anywhere (Wi-Fi needed to work), Just love the upgrades came with this garage unit. Chamberlain Garage Door Opener I would give it 6 stars if I could. Works great. Never wonder if you forgot to close the garage door again. Get a wi-fi extender if you have poor reception. Very easy to setup Had no problem with setup, works to my expectations Works perfect Can’t be happier always work and they send email with updates when will not work. Great! Replaced a 1/4 hp chain drive unit that was extremely loud.  This one is quiet senses movement and turns on light, very helpful. Battery backup got us in after hurricane. Can check whether door is open or closed from smartphone when you forget if you closed it.  Would give it more stars if they were available. NoWorysMan NoWorysMan Close to good, not great, poor support. App does not transfer from WiFi to cellular well, and constantly gives “network issue” warnings. Does not always confirm control or door/Gate position. HomeKit works for garage doors, but not gate controllers (both work in app) - support is woefully untrained. Always loses connection Since recent updates seems to fix the connectivity issues. Would be really cool if it had car play features.\n\nUsed to work great but lately the gateway loses its connection. This is very frustrating when you are in a hurry. Shows connected to my network but app keeps saying offline. Great Saved my butt more than once when I forgot to close the door, or just wanted to be sure. Works if you forget a garage door opener too. Nice app Does what I need but should do more The app opens and closes my garage door without fail. I use this as my primary garage door opener and don’t need a controller in my car anymore. Would be nice to have a widget to make it faster to open and close that also shows door status. An alert if it’s open for XX amount of time would be great too. And please please please update it so it looks right on the iPhone plus. 5 stars once the widget is added and resolution is updated! Great basic open/close but... PLEASE add IFTTT or ADT integration. Not working Not working MyQ retofit Works like magic. Made my older liftmaster opener hi-tech. Install kinda tricky. If you are having problem connecting to your wifi, set it up closer to the router before installing the \"brain\" in your garage wall Rocket Science After searching the web for hours, I found instructions to pair MyQ with Home Kit. The instructions looked like you something I would need to hire a computer programmer to get this to work. Screwed again. Need improvements False notifications are receiving. UI should be lot better The BEST This garage opener runs when you have no electricity!  When we had no electricity for over 24 hrs!  Awesomeness!😊 iPhone 8 Can’t log in!  Either gives an incorrect password entered or nothing happens when log in pressed Good idea, poor execution App constantly falls off network and logs me out. App looks very plain and ugly. Have to buy a $60 piece to make it home kit compatible!? Not very stable. When it works, it's great. When it doesn't, I get locked out of my house. Good app Helps opening and closing garage doors. Also notifies you if garage door remained open Still no homekit Lied to was told home kit would be a future feature but now need to buy new unit Good but some login issues It works well most of the time. There are times when it forces me to login with my credentials yet if I close the app quickly and reopen it, it seems to go right to the garage door without logging in again. I just wish it would work consistently with touch ID so I didn’t have to login and stop to put my car in park etc. Gotta Love it😊 Love my Chamberlain garage opener 😉😉 Very convenient It's really convenient to have an app on my phone to check if I closed the door, for sure or when I'm not using My car and want to enter and exit through the garage. \nThis opener is also so much quieter than the opener I had before. Error Having a lot of error problems Outdated App is still scaled on 7+. Looks really bad. \n\nAlso, charging for Google Home integration? Outrageous! Will never pay. No other service charges me for that sort of integration. World Class! This makes life sooo easy! It  works. It opens and closes your door Time saver from hell!!! If you are like me, who most of the time turns around 2 miles down the road to triple check you've closed the garage door, you need look no further!!!! Not to mention the numerous times I've remotely given access to friends and familly to just the garage (hey, do you have a?) and then assured again that my house was left secured.\n\nOutstanding!!!

        "content": "First of all the app works as described. It shows the status of my garage doors and allows remote opening and closing. Unfortunately the recent update has made the whole process take another step and the door status is not always in sync. This didn’t used to be the case. \n\nCurrently, the app auto logs in and shows the doors. Next you click on the door and a tab slides over to show the status. The status used to be visible without this step and selecting the door would simply open or close the door. Now if the door was opened from the house button the app will still show the status as closed. Selecting the option to “open” will spin the thinking wheel, realize the door is already open, and update the status. Well I wanted to toggle the door, you didn’t give me a close option, so you did nothing. \n\nEven when the app is working and showing the correct door status it takes 4 step instead of 3 to open a door. \n1) open app with auto login\n2) click on door\n3) click on open/close action\n4) thumbprint to authorize\n\nI used to use the app a lot more to open and close the doors and yes one extra step for every use is a big deal. Now I use the door keypad more and walk around to the other doors. \n\nPlease fix the app. Make it easier to open and fix the door status issue. It should be easy to auto check each door status when the app launches and get it correct. Please don’t make me click on the door to show the status and then that status is not even correct.",

It is the most senseless layout and navigation that I have ever seen. It is mostly functional and works about 70% of the time. I have no idea why we live in a culture where that’s all we expect of products we pay for.  I am beyond disturbed by the ear piercingly loud beep played by the product before the garage door goes down, and I similarly can't stand the bright flashing strobe. I have opened up the hardware and removed the beeping element with a pliers, and I have duct taped over the strobe six times to stop the light from getting through. Why it is not an option to turn off the strobe or the beeper with settings - likely the same reason that the interface of the app is so pathetic. Key decision-makers behind this app and product are seriously out of touch with consumers. It won't be long before they are surpassed by more sensible competitors.  Lastly, why would you log users out of your app every time you update the app?  Your competitors don't.   You simply have no sense.",

But it wasn’t all that difficult. \nPrior to installation I had a habit of driving off and not closing the garage door. I blamed it on low-flying airplanes, but it was all me. I’ve set alarms for 6, 12, 30, 60 minutes. One enhancement I’d like is a button on the app to suspend alarms for x minutes, and if the door was open at x+6 minutes, I’d get my first notification. The app works for me all day, every day. \nOn the other hand, I’ve taken a pass on buying the gizmo that would allow Alexa to operate the door. I can’t see how that is useful to me, and if it ain’t broke, why fix it?\nWhen I travel, I have a dog-sitter who visits several times a day. She enters the house via the garage, so the open and close notifications give me assurance that my pups are being cared for. I can even tell how long each visit is.",

I have been in the electronics industry for over 30 years and I have a smart home with over 40 devices that I’ve setup myself. To be fair, the setup on those other devices didn’t always go smoothly, but nothing compares to the My Q app. It has a whole host of bugs in it. I would give it zero stars if I could. The instructions are as clear as mud. The app times out within seconds of pressing a button. Sometimes an option button you need to select doesn’t even show up on the page. But if you refresh the page it miraculously shows up. I could go on and on. Once you decipher how to get your system programmed and working, it works OK. But getting to that point is very frustrating and I was ready to chuck the whole thing a number of times. Good luck with your setup. You’ll need it!",

        "content": "So far I really like my garage door opener. However, there are times where the connection is lost and may take several minutes to reestablish connection. I have verified that I do have Plenty of WiFi where the equipment is mounted. There has also been times to when I open the door and then when I go to close it my device had lost connection. So my question is, is there a way you can add “connection status” to the info being shown to us on the app? Meaning if my wife leaves the house and I get a notification that the garage door is open but do not receive a notification that it has shut that I can verify to make sure the equipment is working and communicating properly? Otherwise I’m blowing up my wife’s phone trying to figure out if she actually shut the door. I could just close it yes, BUT, I would hate for it to really be closed and then I open it to where it loses connection and now my garage door is exposed...sometimes the connection is lost for 30min. This is why if we had a connection status saying the unit is currently connected to the WiFi or if it isn’t connected to WiFi when it loses connection that now I can actually trust the device when I see its current status. From there I would give this device a 5 star review because now there is a way you can confirm that everything is working properly.\n\n On a side note, I’ve also had issues to where it is really windy outside to where is causes my garage door to shake. When this happens the sensor thinks the garage door is going up and down. So whenever the Santa Anna winds come through here in California, I get notifications throughout the night saying my garage door is opening and closing. When I first saw this it freaked me and my wife out to where I grabbed the gun thinking somebody had broken in....wrong...so whenever this happens I just ignore the notifications which I really shouldn’t have to do but ehhh it is what it is.\n\nNot sure if anybody associated with the app actually reads these comments or relays info to the developers???",

The product and app are pieces of junk and I would not recommend anyone purchase them. The issues that I described below have existed since I owned the product, so clearly no one is assigned to fixing these problems, because they persist month over month.\n\n1. Garage door opening on its own. When you live in Minnesota and your garage door opens on its own and you don't know this can create huge problems. Wildlife getting in the garage because we live in a rural area, or pipes freezing in the winter.\n2. Garage door registering up on the app when it's really down and vice versa. This is a huge issue. If you're not home and you cannot tell whether the door is up or down this defeats the entire purpose of owning this product.\n3. The app has a function where you can create rules to close the door automatically. For example, you can create a rule to close the door at 6 PM every day. Every rule I try to create you'll get the same error message: \"Save schedule failed. The schedule cannot be saved at this time. Please check your Internet connection and try again.\" The issue is with the app. No rules will save and all you rules yield the same error message. This has nothing to do with my Internet connection.",

Now you tap once so that the Open or Close button will appear, then you tap on the button to actually operate the door. So this was meant to make it clear whether you are opening or closing but...\n2) On multiple occasions with the latest version, the app has incorrectly shown the open or closed state of the door. For example, if you close the door with the push button switch or keypad (not the app), the app still thinks the door is open. As a result, the app shows you the CLOSE button when the door is already closed! \n\nThis update is *not* an improvement!",

I bought it because someone stole my opener from my car and sometimes I would forget to close my door.\n\nThis system solved both issues for me at first. Not too long ago the app stopped working due to too many attempts. So I tried everything to get it going again.\n\nI reset my router and the MYq hub and reinstalled the app. It would work for a few days and then stop.\n\nI read the forums and found lots of people with the same problem and the Community Managers didn’t have a solution to the problem. \n\nThe error said that it had too many attempts and that’s why it failed.\n\nFinally I changed the battery in the door sensor and for the last couple weeks it has been working!!! If the app or forum could have told me to check my battery then I would be happy but no they only said I had too many attempts.\n\nIt said I had too many attempts on the first try!!!\n\nSecond issue and one of the main reasons I bought the system is/was being able to schedule the garage to close.\n\nFor example I could set up the app to close the door at 10:00pm if it was left open and it worked great!\n\nLast night I left the door open and my wife was a little upset with me this morning. So I figured since I had recently updated the app trying to fix the other issue maybe I needed to set up the schedule again.\n\nAfter several attempts to set up the schedule and the app allowing me to go all the way through the process even prompting me to put a name in for the event, like close at 10 or something like that, when I tried to save it the app tells me I can’t and I need to check my internet connection.\n\nHaving experience with the app and the moronic errors it produces I decided to check the forum instead of checking my internet connection as they suggested.\n\nTHEY DISABLED THIS FEATURE!!!\n\nThey don’t tell you in the app that it’s disabled they just let you make several attempts to set the schedule and tell you to check your internet.\n\nI would buy another chamberlain product if my life depended on it!!! I have two of their openers and have had several in the past but no more!!!",

A couple of years ago it worked flawlessly and consistently well. In the last year it gives of multiple frequent false notifications——at all hours. I have had the thing go off at 2am ten or more times in a row saying the door opened and closed the door opened and closed on and on!!!\nThe tech support always says to delete app and reset up the bridge and all openers like you did when you got it!!! This is pain as I have four openers at two houses and three bridges. And I have to climb on a ladder (garage ceilings are 10 feet high).  Also the alerts/notifications used to be immediate now they are delayed a bit. Not sure if there is a better product or not.  My guess is the product is great but the behind the scenes computers software etc are not as good as they used to be.",

When this happens, If I stand still, close the app and restart it, something is reset and the app will open or close the garage door as expected.\n\n3) The developer(s) don’t seem to be interested in replying back about the problems that I have reported to them involving especially that startup login screen issue.",

At this point I’d say my smart house is brilliant so with all of the programming I have done I am confident it wasn’t me doing something wrong.\n\nThe app is very cluttered to me, I deleted my other linked devices to clean it up some. \n\nSuggestions:\n\nAllow us to select the icon for the door. I have a three car garage, one is a single and one is a double yet the only icon I can select is a single garage door.  It would make it easier those of us over 40 that require reading glasses.  You could have a single door, a double door or a house showing a three car garage with single left and right configurations as well as two single doors and two double doors for other common configurations.  That way we can just tap on the side we want opened. \n\nMy August lock is super easy to read, green circle means unlocked and red circle means locked. You could change the color of the icon with the status.\n\nIf you are Apple HomeKit compatible where is the QR code on my box or in my quick set up guide?  My other stuff was so easy to integrate. \n\nAnd why two apps?  LiftMaster and Chamberlain, you are all the same company, I know I’ve been to your Elmhurst office.

I’m just waiting for the “we had all N million accounts stolen” email.\n\nNext, anyone who wants to control (say) a garage door from the app must logon to that account. Yes, that’s right, there is NO ability to allow access by family members. Because, of course, no-one has children or partners, right? So you have to share the account credentials with family members. Oh yes, and they promised to fix this .. a year ago. Still waiting.\n\nOh, and you ALWAYS have to go through the account logon screen when you start the app. Even if it has remembered your credentials. Why?\n\nNow for the Apple Watch app, which is hilarious. You open the Apple Watch app, which then sits waiting for you to use the iPhone app to logon to your account .. after which you can go BACK to the Watch app to open or close the garage door. But of course, since you are forced to open the iPhone app (where you can open the garage door), what, precisely, do you save using the Watch app???\n\nWhat a sad mess.",

Then, after it finally was released, I find out it’s two different and separate hubs... I guess one to talk to the opener and one to talk to HomeKit??? Anyway... instead of working “within HomeKit” like they Tech CSR said it would, one still must create an account and upload data to a third party server before you can even set it up. \n\nI LOVE the “minimalist” Apple Way... \n... but this solution is far from it. \n\nI’ll keep it for now, or until a better solution is released, and will update my rating in the future... maybe.",

So it opened my door then closed my door and the app stated the process had failed to register. I tried it again. Same problem failed to register. I then tried it using my wife’s iPhone but no luck with that either. I had to call technical support. After waiting ten minutes to get a human voice to answer. He began walking me thru the process but we came across the same problem failed to register. I he then told me to press the number 1 button on the back of the hub. Then right after pressing 1 he had me press the test button on the sensor. Once we did that the device completed the setup. Whew what a pain the instructions are very poor and needs a technical person to rewrite them. Thanks to tech support my garage door can be opened remotely now.",

        "content": "My only hesitation with this device came last November when the bridge acted strange and wouldn't let me log in. I reset the bridge several times and the light kept blinking. The app kept telling me there was an error. That happened on two separate occasions and persisted for about a week both times. Prior to that there were no problems. Since the second time, there have not been issues either, but that shook my confidence a bit. If not for that, it is a great app in that it tells you the current status of the garage door, and how long it's been down. There's not much more that someone would need. A running log of opening and closing would probably be the ultimate upgrade they could provide. Beyond that, there isn't anything I can think of that they could do with the system as it stands. For me, it's convenient to open my door when I'm on a walk and a few houses down, but I've yet to need to open it remotely from a distance. After the glitch I had, I'm hesitant to open it without knowing for sure I can close it. But it is really nice to check remotely to see if family members made it home for the night. It's also great to make sure the door is down without getting out of bed. If you are someone who gets halfway to your destination and forgets whether you shut the door, you can just hop on the app and check.",

Once set up, the MyQ app is a good tool, however, Chamberlain’s greed ruined the possibility of opening and closing the garage door using IFTTT with Google Home without having to pay to upgrade the service. Seriously, allowing people to use their voice instead of their fingers is worth charging an added fee? I feel sorry for the amputees that are being discriminated against. Everyone should enjoy free access to be able to open and close their garage door. Shame on Chamberlain for being greedy and charging the added fee to those seeking convenience.",

Now they want to sell a $50 Apple HomeKit hub, which is not their fault, but still a pain. The application supposedly links with Nest but it is a joke as nest already has its own app and they need you to manually use this app to open or close your garage\nDoor and then swipe to the nest icons and then manually turn off or on your nest thermostats or set them to home or away manually. LOL. That is not automation and no integration whatsoever. Very funny and very misleading. Until they get their game together with integration go with one of the other brands",

I can even do this from the coffee shop (not sure of the reason).\n\nWhy not make this app into something useful?\n- alarm me when the door doesn't close because of the sensors activating it (left a shovel under the door)\n- automatically open the door when my phone comes back into wifi range (you know...I'm home again)\n- alert me when the door is open at a custom time range and provide the option to auto shut the door (in case I go to bed and forgot to shut it)\n- give me the option to fully lockout anyone entering the garage at a custom time range (like when I'm in bed)...alert me if someone tries to enter.\n- let me program when the light come on/off\n- let me remotely set a temporary passcode for entry\n- Track how many times my door has opened and closed and provide me with maintenance recommendations...maybe even tie into a service that automatically comes out to lubricate/adjust springs/alignment/service opener\n\nYou could make this into something that is really useful...right now it is something that is just really expensive.  Nice part about it is that  all you have to do is program the app and update it...oh yeah and decide to do it.  Hey, maybe I should be the product manager for this product now!",

  "report": "iTunes Review Report \ntotal:500 avg:3.01\n★ 164 ★★ 59 ★★★ 60 ★★★★ 41 ★★★★★ 176\n\nLove it! by Jess bland\n★★★★★\nLove knowing when my kids are home from school as well as if my garage door actually closed.\n2018-04-12 10:55:14 AM v3.100\n\nWorks reliably needs more 3rd party integration by Bham DavidB\n★★★★★\nI use chamberlain, along with homeseer home automation. \n\nWhen it is left open i am notified, and i can use an unlimited number of alerts, all just using myq.\n\nChamberlain used to be “open”, but they closed it down for some platforms. A good ha product should be open to work with everything from alexa to smartthings and everything else.\n\nUniversal compatibility would make this great product even better.\n\nIt gets 5 stars for this app, easy to program, fast, and doesn't crash.\n2018-04-09 8:48:16 AM v3.100\n\nWould be great if you could count on it. by PaulD233\n★★\nIt’s a great concept, and it works a lot of the time. But kind of like a parachute, this needs to work all the time. Frequent false open/closed statuses make this impossible to trust. Right now, it says my door is open but it it closed.\n2018-04-07 11:19:23 PM v3.100\n\nFalse Notifications. by Last Week iPhone Newbie\n★★\nStarting April 2018, the app began sending push notifications indicating that my garage door was left open when it’s actually closed.\n2018-04-06 3:59:59 PM v3.100\n\nGREG by Gregorio2011\n★\nIt would not accept my half a dozen pass word I tried. NOT STRONG ENOUG?\nIt ridicules\n2018-04-06 3:32:25 PM v3.100\n\nSoftware lacking by Nutmaster\n★★\nFeatures like scheduling STILL don’t work. No Alexa support even though it was promised. Constant battle trying to get the software to run properly. Integration with IFTTT also buggy. There are better solutions out there.\n2018-04-04 7:22:42 AM v3.100\n\nFails all the time by zerocoolyme?\n★\nThe developers of this app didn’t test for people driving up to their house and opening their garages as their network switches from LTE to their home WiFi. Once this network switch happens the whole system locks out and you have to sit for ten minutes out front of your house waiting for the dumb app to correct itself\n2018-04-03 9:11:05 PM v3.100\n\nFailure to close by SilentBiscuit\n★★\nThis was one of my favorite apps, it was quick easy to use and brought simplicity and peace of mind. After the last update, it stopped working correctly. I can open my doors immediately but am unable to close them. The hub flashes and beeps but never sends a signal to close. I continually have to close the door manually. If I use my remote that came with the door, then they close fine and instantly. Not sure why I cant get the door to close from this app.\n2018-04-02 12:09:10 PM v3.100\n\nNo Amazon Echo integration by M12347975\n★★★\nOnly Smarthome device that doesn't integrate to Amazon Echo.\n2018-04-01 9:04:13 PM v3.100\n\nSlow and unreliable by Nmhawkins1\n★★\nWorks 2/3rds of the time. Would be great if it was more stable. Takes too long to load too.\n2018-03-29 2:37:22 PM v3.100\n\nRecent update was a step backwards by jonnyEvergreen\n★★★\nFirst of all the app works as described. It shows the status of my garage doors and allows remote opening and closing. Unfortunately the recent update has made the whole process take another step and the door status is not always in sync. This didn’t used to be the case. \n\nCurrently, the app auto logs in and shows the doors. Next you click on the door and a tab slides over to show the status. The status used to be visible without this step and selecting the door would simply open or close the door. Now if the door was opened from the house button the app will still show the status as closed. Selecting the option to “open” will spin the thinking wheel, realize the door is already open, and update the status. Well I wanted to toggle the door, you didn’t give me a close option, so you did nothing. \n\nEven when the app is working and showing the correct door status it takes 4 step instead of 3 to open a door. \n1) open app with auto login\n2) click on door\n3) click on open/close action\n4) thumbprint to authorize\n\nI used to use the app a lot more to open and close the doors and yes one extra step for every use is a big deal. Now I use the door keypad more and walk around to the other doors. \n\nPlease fix the app. Make it easier to open and fix the door status issue. It should be easy to auto check each door status when the app launches and get it correct. Please don’t make me click on the door to show the status and then that status is not even correct.\n2018-03-29 12:46:56 PM v3.100\n\nUseless by hermi123\n★\nApp only works when connected to WiFi. So if I’m out, and on the road, you can’t use it. Completely useless do not trust it at all almost been locked out of my house a few times.\n2018-03-29 10:15:52 AM v3.100\n\nWeak Sauce by RobFlizzle\n★★\nNo Alexa integration, app feels dated, not easy to update WiFi passwords\n2018-03-24 8:51:05 PM v3.100\n\nApp screenshots misleading by Pjmax190\n★\nThe app no longer opens up to a large view of the garage door as the screenshots suggests.  Instead they’ve made it 1/10 the size and is very annoying to try and hit while approaching your house.  Please bring back the large view like shown in the App Store preview.\n2018-03-20 7:16:08 AM v3.100\n\nLove Chamberlain, But Needs Improvement by Arcadian_Rebel\n★★★\nI’m big into smart home automation so this app is definitely one of my favorites! However, there is so much potential left on the table. The developers need to bring motion alerts and temperature monitoring to the app. I run server hardware in my garage and having these two features in the app would make a huge difference.\n2018-03-19 5:08:16 AM v3.100\n\nIdiots. by BookNut1924\n★★\nThis app was fine, until the latest update. Apparently, some idiot thought that for an app you’re going to use in your car, it made sense to make the buttons smaller AND require a second press to confirm that yes, you do want to open your garage door. While you’re driving.\n2018-03-18 6:33:55 PM v3.100\n\nNo alexa integration by Justin 28562\n★\nOk otherwise\n2018-03-15 12:47:23 PM v3.100\n\nLess than one star; useless by Annoyed by auto-refreshing\n★\nThis is as minimal and bare bones as possible and it's quite useless. It allows opening and closing the door and nothing else in the app works on any of my phones or tablets. There are so many functions they could add but haven't. This is a POS.\n2018-03-13 8:37:10 PM v3.100\n\nA fee to connect to IFTTT by Rynoyes\n★\nLook else where if you can!  I won’t buy another product from them.\n2018-03-11 7:20:54 AM v3.100\n\nLast update by Ptxmax\n★\nVery rude customer service \nThe last update make this application worse and it's not working properly freezing with my face id on the screen.\n\nBefore you had  a chance to change from big garage icon and small to accommodate more doors and with one touch open and close the door.\nNow you still have 2 choices but the garage icon are the same and you need to touch twice the screen to open the garage door.\nInstead to make it easy they complicated this app...\nI'm an old person with an iPhone 5 and\nusing this app it's a nightmare the garage icon it's so small that I can't see it.\nDear Chamberlain if you want make something fancy, work on FACE ID without touching the screen.\nThank Chamberlain to make me nervous every time I use it.\nI apologize for my English\n2018-03-09 3:16:36 PM v3.100\n\nWorst software EVER by PatricknLA\n★\nIf you like crap you have come to the right spot, beyond hit and miss absolutely horrible.  Look at other companies and software over this always on the “blink”\n2018-03-08 10:53:01 AM v3.100\n\nYuck by Ed Proffer\n★\nI am rarely compelled to write a negative review. But this app's interface is utterly pathetic. This company needs to hire experienced and skilled user interface designers. It is the most senseless layout and navigation that I have ever seen. It is mostly functional and works about 70% of the time. I have no idea why we live in a culture where that’s all we expect of products we pay for.  I am beyond disturbed by the ear piercingly loud beep played by the product before the garage door goes down, and I similarly can't stand the bright flashing strobe. I have opened up the hardware and removed the beeping element with a pliers, and I have duct taped over the strobe six times to stop the light from getting through. Why it is not an option to turn off the strobe or the beeper with settings - likely the same reason that the interface of the app is so pathetic. Key decision-makers behind this app and product are seriously out of touch with consumers. It won't be long before they are surpassed by more sensible competitors.  Lastly, why would you log users out of your app every time you update the app?  Your competitors don't.   You simply have no sense.\n2018-03-08 8:26:07 AM v3.100\n\nLatest update by Superman Scully\n★★★★\nPlease revert back to the one tap opening feature. With the newest update I have smaller icons that I have to tap twice in order to open my garage door. I use with with my motorcycle so this isn't a welcomed feature.\n2018-03-06 9:27:22 PM v3.100\n\nMake the icon larger by MJ,s\n★★★★\nWorks good, but latest update makes the garage door icon too small, was fine before.\n2018-03-05 8:07:19 AM v3.100\n\nWorthless by Duke 123\n★\nDoes not consistently work.\n2018-03-04 6:23:35 PM v3.100\n\nHorrible by Melhee Gibson\n★\nMost inconsistent app I've used for home automation. Garage opens on its own. Partial close. Partial open. Sometimes works sometimes doesn't. Error after error gets annoying. No way of closing app fully when it's stuck and the wheel just spins. The setup instructions are garbage.  Don't waste your money.\n2018-03-04 11:37:07 AM v3.100\n\nAwesome app and product by Gmo79\n★★★★★\nI wish everything worked as great as this app!  Response time for opening and closing are amazing.  Kēvo Kwikset could learn some things from this app...\n2018-03-04 11:27:08 AM v3.100\n\nDoes more than I need by Mickeydid\n★★★★★\nI’ve had the app and hub in operation for about 2 years. The installation was okay, though I think they were written for someone who had installed similar Wi-Fi home automation devices. But it wasn’t all that difficult. \nPrior to installation I had a habit of driving off and not closing the garage door. I blamed it on low-flying airplanes, but it was all me. I’ve set alarms for 6, 12, 30, 60 minutes. One enhancement I’d like is a button on the app to suspend alarms for x minutes, and if the door was open at x+6 minutes, I’d get my first notification. The app works for me all day, every day. \nOn the other hand, I’ve taken a pass on buying the gizmo that would allow Alexa to operate the door. I can’t see how that is useful to me, and if it ain’t broke, why fix it?\nWhen I travel, I have a dog-sitter who visits several times a day. She enters the house via the garage, so the open and close notifications give me assurance that my pups are being cared for. I can even tell how long each visit is.\n2018-03-04 11:03:53 AM v3.100\n\nApp not working by Bbjh567\n★\nWorked fine for 4 days then said could not fine sever. Now app will not do anything when I hit login. Will not send email for new pass either. Please fix app!!!!\n2018-03-04 10:17:27 AM v3.100\n\nUpdate Broke Apple Watch App by JamesJpn\n★\nThe new update broke the Apple Watch app. The app will say that it’s updating, then show Door as Closed but the garage door icon continues to show the updating circular graphic. Reboot on watch and iPhone fixes nothing. QA testing people!!!\n2018-03-03 4:01:01 PM v3.100\n\nTerrible and buggy HomeKit by CiClaff\n★\nTerrible and buggy HomeKit\n2018-03-03 2:24:55 PM v3.100\n\nWorst App I’ve Ever Used by Spice Daddy\n★\nThis is a perfect example of someone who created an app for a product for which they don’t understand the operation. I have been in the electronics industry for over 30 years and I have a smart home with over 40 devices that I’ve setup myself. To be fair, the setup on those other devices didn’t always go smoothly, but nothing compares to the My Q app. It has a whole host of bugs in it. I would give it zero stars if I could. The instructions are as clear as mud. The app times out within seconds of pressing a button. Sometimes an option button you need to select doesn’t even show up on the page. But if you refresh the page it miraculously shows up. I could go on and on. Once you decipher how to get your system programmed and working, it works OK. But getting to that point is very frustrating and I was ready to chuck the whole thing a number of times. Good luck with your setup. You’ll need it!\n2018-03-03 10:41:28 AM v3.100\n\nBad bad bad! by Heisvajgds\n★\nI get constant false alerts on my phone that my garage door is up. I rush home from work only to find out that it is down! \nI have even been at home when I got the “garage up” later, yet the door never moved!! \nRight now the app is telling me that my garage door had been up for 12 days. \nI give up. Causes me more grief with false alarms!\nAlso the remote function works 50% at best. \nVery disappointed in this product.\n2018-03-03 9:50:04 AM v3.100\n\nGreat product and stable by Tom-sfc\n★★★★★\nDoes not work with Alexa. Please develop this. I suggest having Alexa announce when the garage door is opening or closing, when the door is open longer than X minutes between X-Y hours, and the ability to open and close door.

The previous versions provided a large icon that was very easy to use especially while in the car. Please consider giving the user the option to choose the icon size. Thanks\n2018-03-02 4:37:44 PM v3.100\n\nLocked out of my house again. by Nathan Thrills\n★★★\nProbably the 10th time I’ve been locked out.\n2018-03-01 2:21:07 PM v3.98\n\nDon’t update! by Coleanm\n★\nThis app always worked until I did the most recent update.

Are used to just launch the application and then tap the garage door. Now I have to tap the garage door and then tap the open button. Don’t take away useful features. At least make it. configurable\n2018-02-28 6:44:17 PM v3.98\n\nNever worry by 12Easy\n★★★★★\nBefore I bought this I can’t tell you how many times I turned around and went back to check if I had closed the garage! No worry now and if it does open I get a notification. I feel very safe.\n2018-02-28 11:40:02 AM v3.98\n\nLatest update a step backwards by Deben2859\n★\nWhy in the world would you make the icon so small and crammed in the corner of the screen. Not sure who is writing this or QA’ing but they need to be questioned\n2018-02-28 6:13:32 AM v3.98\n\nGreat idea - can’t quite trust it by GeekBill\n★★★\nWhen it works it’s great. But not 100% accurate - once in a awhile it will say door is closed when it’s open or vice versa. If high wind vibrates the garage door the sensor gets confused. A big point for us is checking to see if we remembered to shut the garage door when we’re gone - but just can’t quite trust it.\n\nAlso a recent app upgrade caused it to forget our door openers and I had to repeat the setup. I live in Minnesota - it’s COLD and SNOWY in February - bad time to have to back out the cars and need extra garage door cycles setting up the app. Grrrr.\n2018-02-26 4:57:23 PM v3.98\n\nAnyway to update app to show a “Connection Status” by thatguymatt87\n★★★★\nSo far I really like my garage door opener. However, there are times where the connection is lost and may take several minutes to reestablish connection. I have verified that I do have Plenty of WiFi where the equipment is mounted. There has also been times to when I open the door and then when I go to close it my device had lost connection. So my question is, is there a way you can add “connection status” to the info being shown to us on the app? Meaning if my wife leaves the house and I get a notification that the garage door is open but do not receive a notification that it has shut that I can verify to make sure the equipment is working and communicating properly? Otherwise I’m blowing up my wife’s phone trying to figure out if she actually shut the door. I could just close it yes, BUT, I would hate for it to really be closed and then I open it to where it loses connection and now my garage door is exposed...sometimes the connection is lost for 30min. This is why if we had a connection status saying the unit is currently connected to the WiFi or if it isn’t connected to WiFi when it loses connection that now I can actually trust the device when I see its current status. From there I would give this device a 5 star review because now there is a way you can confirm that everything is working properly.\n\n On a side note, I’ve also had issues to where it is really windy outside to where is causes my garage door to shake. When this happens the sensor thinks the garage door is going up and down. So whenever the Santa Anna winds come through here in California, I get notifications throughout the night saying my garage door is opening and closing. When I first saw this it freaked me and my wife out to where I grabbed the gun thinking somebody had broken in....wrong...so whenever this happens I just ignore the notifications which I really shouldn’t have to do but ehhh it is what it is.\n\nNot sure if anybody associated with the app actually reads these comments or relays info to the developers???\n2018-02-26 7:52:50 AM v3.98\n\nWhat Happened by CIREYELIAB\n★★★\nSince the latest update the garage door icon has shrunk significantly in size. Not a fan. After reading a few blogs in this topic there is no fix or way to go back to the larger icon. The only way I see this change as a positive is if you have multiple openers in the same app. I HATE this change.\n2018-02-23 2:19:50 PM v3.98\n\nNew update is bad by Wtfomgkthxbie\n★\nApp was great until they messed with something that was not broken .

My biggest complaint is that it can be hard to read when I’m on my bike, which is when I use the app the most. It would be helpful if the app used a different color to show if the door is open or closed. Either that or use a much larger font and/or a much bigger picture.\n2018-02-20 12:52:40 AM v3.98\n\nLatest update makes NO sense by Killer's Dad\n★★★\nBefore the latest update, you opened the app, tapped the garage door icon.\n\nNow you have to open the app, tap the garage door icon, then tap Open to the far right of the icon you just tapped. \n\nHey, why make it harder to drive and open the door????\n2018-02-19 9:08:23 PM v3.98\n\nDelayed Notifications by The Bui's\n★\nIt freaks me out when I get messages stating that my garage door just open when I'm hours away from realizing the the notification was delayed by a couple of hours. I decided to test to see if it's just me being far away from the device so standing in front on my garage door, I opened and closed the door. 30 min later I get a notification that the door just open and closed. My modem/router is literally 3 feet away from the chamberlain device with no obstruction in site.\n\nI’ve been getting false alerts for the last couple of days! Battery is good and no wind.

Please return the app back to the bigger icon with one touch!\n2018-02-18 9:31:56 PM v3.98\n\nTerrible app and product by QA manager by profession\n★\nI have had this product and app for over a year. During that time I have experienced many glitches. The product and app are pieces of junk and I would not recommend anyone purchase them. The issues that I described below have existed since I owned the product, so clearly no one is assigned to fixing these problems, because they persist month over month.\n\n1. Garage door opening on its own. When you live in Minnesota and your garage door opens on its own and you don't know this can create huge problems. Wildlife getting in the garage because we live in a rural area, or pipes freezing in the winter.\n2. Garage door registering up on the app when it's really down and vice versa. This is a huge issue. If you're not home and you cannot tell whether the door is up or down this defeats the entire purpose of owning this product.\n3. The app has a function where you can create rules to close the door automatically. For example, you can create a rule to close the door at 6 PM every day. Every rule I try to create you'll get the same error message: \"Save schedule failed. The schedule cannot be saved at this time. Please check your Internet connection and try again.\" The issue is with the app. No rules will save and all you rules yield the same error message. This has nothing to do with my Internet connection.\n2018-02-18 6:45:36 PM v3.98\n\nDisappointed with Apple Watch by Wingle24\n★★★\nExcited to have my Apple Watch 3 so could leave my phone behind on runs/rides. Low and behold, the chamberlain app on my Apple Watch keeps saying “login on your phone for security purposes”. That’s great, I love being locked out with my phone in the house.

With the previous version it was a one-tap process. Now you tap once so that the Open or Close button will appear, then you tap on the button to actually operate the door. So this was meant to make it clear whether you are opening or closing but...\n2) On multiple occasions with the latest version, the app has incorrectly shown the open or closed state of the door. For example, if you close the door with the push button switch or keypad (not the app), the app still thinks the door is open. As a result, the app shows you the CLOSE button when the door is already closed! \n\nThis update is *not* an improvement!\n2018-02-11 10:40:45 AM v3.98\n\nGreat idea, but... by DJ49878\n★★\nI love the idea, and the alerts, but how is it possible to get a Door Open alert when the door has not moved??\nIf false alerts can’t be fixed, I’ll have to unplug the hub and remove the app.\n2018-02-10 5:56:33 AM v3.98\n\nStopped working after a bit by Wespenttoomuch\n★★★★\nOur garage door opened stopped working\n2018-02-09 9:29:49 PM v3.98\n\nKnow when it’s open by LaundryNumber36\n★★★★★\nThe best feature is knowing when the door is opened.\n2018-02-09 2:50:47 PM v3.98\n\nBroke by ShackieChan\n★\nBroke since last update.....need to stop updating it if your gonna break it every time\n2018-02-09 10:34:12 AM v3.98\n\nNew interface is awful by Neutral Observer\n★\nLast update makes longtime interface very user unfriendly, shrunk icons much more difficult to see and use.\nWere already too many steps when trying to open garage door quickly, now they have added yet one more very annoying\n2018-02-09 7:29:14 AM v3.98\n\nNew update went from one click to two by JobyLewis\n★\nWhy would I tap the door if I didn’t want to open or close it?

Come on geniuses, 99% of the time we, the real people, use this app when we are behind the wheel either coming or leaving our homes, so we don't need the extra step to open or close the garage door.\n2018-02-03 12:41:43 PM v3.96.1\n\nLove this product by CSX in Indy\n★★★★★\nI used to drive around the block to see if I closed the garage door, but not since I installed my new opener from Chamberlain.

I bought it because someone stole my opener from my car and sometimes I would forget to close my door.\n\nThis system solved both issues for me at first. Not too long ago the app stopped working due to too many attempts. So I tried everything to get it going again.\n\nI reset my router and the MYq hub and reinstalled the app. It would work for a few days and then stop.\n\nI read the forums and found lots of people with the same problem and the Community Managers didn’t have a solution to the problem. \n\nThe error said that it had too many attempts and that’s why it failed.\n\nFinally I changed the battery in the door sensor and for the last couple weeks it has been working!!! If the app or forum could have told me to check my battery then I would be happy but no they only said I had too many attempts.\n\nIt said I had too many attempts on the first try!!!\n\nSecond issue and one of the main reasons I bought the system is/was being able to schedule the garage to close.\n\nFor example I could set up the app to close the door at 10:00pm if it was left open and it worked great!\n\nLast night I left the door open and my wife was a little upset with me this morning. So I figured since I had recently updated the app trying to fix the other issue maybe I needed to set up the schedule again.\n\nAfter several attempts to set up the schedule and the app allowing me to go all the way through the process even prompting me to put a name in for the event, like close at 10 or something like that, when I tried to save it the app tells me I can’t and I need to check my internet connection.\n\nHaving experience with the app and the moronic errors it produces I decided to check the forum instead of checking my internet connection as they suggested.\n\nTHEY DISABLED THIS FEATURE!!!\n\nThey don’t tell you in the app that it’s disabled they just let you make several attempts to set the schedule and tell you to check your internet.\n\nI would buy another chamberlain product if my life depended on it!!! I have two of their openers and have had several in the past but no more!!!\n2018-02-02 11:45:45 AM v3.96.1\n\nHelp! by Ochasasas\n★★\nThe app stopped working over a week ago. It tells me our password isn’t correct. It is. So I sent multiple emails asking to reset the password. It’s says Chamberlain will send an email for reset. Never get emails. Not going to spam/trash.

Rather than the one door shown (like in your advertised screenshot which is now inaccurate) I cannot have a one button access. This makes it dangerous for me to use because my one large button is now a very small one in the upper left corner that requires two button confirmation to continue. I HATE that I am forced to waste literally 90% of my screen and am forced to look away from the ROAD to look at the details on my phone and do a two button confirmation (rather than just push the middle of my phone ONCE without looking).

I *often* get 'Error' messages that read \"The gateway or hub is offline. Please check the power and network connections. (309)\" My WiFi connection is strong. It just simply doesn't work much of the time. Even when it does work, I often get false positives. It will indicate that the door just opened, but I'll go outside to check, and it's still down. Furthermore, I've accidently left my garage door open all day, which has twice opened me up to garage burglaries, and this app didn't show that the door was up. I'd estimate that 25% of the time, it works 50% of the time, and 75% of the time, it works 0% of the time.\n2018-01-22 4:45:14 PM v3.96.1\n\nLove it by Wolverine1428\n★★★★★\nGreat opener.

It works fine for a while but, if anything changes, say that it looses connection to house WiFi for any length of time, I will then have to reset the device and try to reconnect to my house WiFi. And that takes repeated attempts. And then somehow it connects after doing just the same thing I did four or five time is a row. I always debate with myself whether the effort to reconnect it is worth my time. Like today, where I have decided that it is.

I do wish there could be support for Apple CarPlay. It would be so cool to be able to open/close the garage from my car’s control screen. It’s just a suggestion. The rest of the app’s functionality is perfect, the only problems I have ever run into is the safety sensor being blocked and that’s not even the App’s fault. So I give the app 5 stars.\n2018-01-07 4:45:48 PM v3.96.1\n\nFix the malfunction!!! by Chago1\n★\nOver 100 alerts in an hour is obnoxious and tolerable fix the malfunction!!!!!\n2018-01-07 1:37:38 PM v3.96.1\n\nFlawless by TxAdamFitz\n★★★★★\nWe absolutely love our MyQ garage door opener and app. The notifications when the door is open or closed is really helpful when we are out of town. Saves the extra time of having to go back home if I forgot to close the door. Being able to open or close from the app is handy. The history log is great as well.\n2018-01-06 4:53:02 PM v3.96.1\n\nOpens and closes by WD5BRP\n★★★★★\nI’ve been using it for past year and it works great!\n2018-01-06 9:13:13 AM v3.96.1\n\nAnnoying pop ups. by hajctnzjb\n★\nAny app that has pop ups constantly asking me to rate it gets an automatic 1 star.

A couple of years ago it worked flawlessly and consistently well. In the last year it gives of multiple frequent false notifications——at all hours. I have had the thing go off at 2am ten or more times in a row saying the door opened and closed the door opened and closed on and on!!!\nThe tech support always says to delete app and reset up the bridge and all openers like you did when you got it!!! This is pain as I have four openers at two houses and three bridges. And I have to climb on a ladder (garage ceilings are 10 feet high).  Also the alerts/notifications used to be immediate now they are delayed a bit. Not sure if there is a better product or not.  My guess is the product is great but the behind the scenes computers software etc are not as good as they used to be.\n2017-12-31 11:56:51 AM v3.96.1\n\nCant get alerts via notifications by goinyard19\n★\nThe only reason I want this product is to know when my door opens and closes. I don’t want to have to check the app to see the activity. I want a notification sent to my phone. I can’t get the alerts to work. The app won’t edit my info to include my phone number. It acts like it saved my edits but when I come back to it, the info is gone. My other opener is a Genie with the same feature and their app has no issues.\n2017-12-31 7:22:21 AM v3.96.1\n\nThis app is garbage! by Sax2cool\n★\nI’m constantly resetting my login password!

The doors never connected to the gateways correctly, even though the units lit up. Simply doesn’t work.\n2017-12-28 4:43:43 PM v3.96.1\n\nComforting by jcow737\n★★★★★\nLove knowing that the house is safe.\n2017-12-28 8:52:34 AM v3.96.1\n\nCould use improvement by Cyborgeeked\n★★\nThe app is ok, works most of the time, but is incredibly slow. I mean, it might be faster to send a letter home to your family, asking them to open the garage door. The app requires you to sign in. Every time. The Touch ID log in will only pop up 1/10 times, forcing you to re-enter your username. I don’t even want to imagine how annoying it must be for Face-ID. \n\nI’ve since resorted to sending up smoke signals whenever I start coming home, in hopes that I get inside my house before midnight.\n2017-12-27 4:10:48 PM v3.96.1\n\nAwesome!! by OHKY Gem City\n★★★★★\nI've had the opener for two years now and I love it!! Works well and I never have to worry about if I forget to close the garage.\n2017-12-27 7:58:27 AM v3.96.1\n\nNever works by IH8HBO\n★\n99% of the time I need to use it it just locks up with the spinning icon like its trying to connect or it gives some bogus error of too many close attempts. This one is best when all the doors are already closed and you're trying to open them. Worst \"connected home\" product I own by far.\n2017-12-27 5:57:00 AM v3.96.1\n\nAdd support for Echo by Me90876\n★★★★\nPlease add support for echo\n2017-12-26 11:10:41 PM v3.96.1\n\nWorks by Flthc\n★★★★\nWorks as advertised but kinda pain to set it up.

I loved it so much, I brought it with me when I moved.  Reliable, helpful and gives me peace of mind.  Thanks Chamberlain!\n2017-12-25 8:26:17 PM v3.96.1\n\nUse to work with echo by femaleracer1\n★★★\nNow it doesn't\n2017-12-25 9:34:32 AM v3.96.1\n\nMyQ (Raynor, Dixon IL - Todd N.) by coolskim\n★★★★★\nGarage door opener works great \nQuiet compared to my older model Chamberlain and the MyQ app works seamlessly. Thanks.\n2017-12-24 10:14:54 AM v3.96.1\n\nIssues with app by By c# software developer\n★★\n1) The application was designed to prompt the user for a username and password at startup. If you accidentally bump the screen, the login information is lost and you have to key it back in.  It is easy to clear this information and I don’t know why this login information was not put on a separate screen.\n\n2) Sometimes the app times out and gives a network error for no reason.  When this happens, If I stand still, close the app and restart it, something is reset and the app will open or close the garage door as expected.\n\n3) The developer(s) don’t seem to be interested in replying back about the problems that I have reported to them involving especially that startup login screen issue.\n2017-12-23 2:51:03 PM v3.96.1\n\nLove this app! by Npgfrt\n★★★★★\nThis app is perfect!!! Thanks for creating this app!!\n2017-12-23 8:12:27 AM v3.96.1\n\nLatest update messed up by Bvsbabu\n★\nI generally don't update the apps, but I made a mistake on updating this app and the user interface is full of bugs. It sends false alerts, shows me as battery low and doesn't do anything now.\n\nThey didn't do simple testing before releasing the app update.\n2017-12-22 10:08:44 PM v3.96.1\n\nAlerts don’t work by itsnbadude\n★\nThey used to, now they don’t\n2017-12-22 2:17:55 PM v3.96.1\n\nWorks pretty good... by Mmaslank\n★★★★\nWorks pretty good but it would be super useful if I could set up a temporary access code for the remote keypad through this app...just a thought\n2017-12-22 1:29:34 PM v3.96.1\n\nFreezes by Shoultz2016\n★★\nWorks about half the time. Other half it sits and spins.\n2017-12-22 10:21:40 AM v3.96.1\n\nRequest by 1Review2RuleThemAll\n★★★\nThe garage door app control is finally working fine after changing the cell battery in the door sensor. Can you add a low battery alert to app? Can you add auto garage door close after X amount of minutes using scrolling numbers to set the time till close? With that, a reminder option that door will be closing in 2-minutes reminder. Can you add a push notification reminder that the garage door is open after X amount of time maybe like 5, 10, or 15 minutes depending on user selection?\n2017-12-21 1:37:42 PM v3.96.1\n\nMore Alert customizations by TosinAde\n★★★★\nI’m satisfied with this product and functionalities. However, there’s room for improvement. For instance, on numerous occasions, I’ve left my garage door open all day unknowingly. I’ve left it open all day while at work and other instances either moving stuffs back and fort the garage etc... I think it will be good if further movement customizations could be built in. So say, I could enable an alert that will prompt me if my garage has been opened for 1hr, 2hrs, 5 hrs etc.\nThanks for this product!!!\n2017-12-21 12:13:30 AM v3.96.1\n\nOne star by thangbqn\n★\nSometimes it’s work crazy\n2017-12-20 9:04:39 PM v3.96.1\n\nDoors out of sync by johnmac10\n★★\nNot sure why but doors seem to get out of sync. Have alerts set up and will get one after we leave home. Will then actually open the door when it is giving me a false alarm open.  Not fun. Was interested to see the home bridge product but this functionality should have been in v1.\n2017-12-20 8:23:27 PM v3.96.1\n\n1 feature missing by Cptn. McAwesome Pants\n★★★★★\nThis app is great. Does what it's supposed to do dependably, however, if there could be a minor GUI update, it would be perfect. I just want the ability to change the order of my garage doors. When I get home and I want to open my left side door, I have to click the door on the right in my app. I'm sure this has to do with the order that I originally set them up in but it would be nice if the app would have a way to drag and drop them in a different order. It's a minor thing so I still give it 5 stars cause it's still a great app. Just giving a small suggestion incase the developers are listening.\n2017-12-20 5:31:16 PM v3.96.1\n\nClosed System - No Alexa integration by sciandri\n★\nUnfortunately No integration with Alexa or any plans to support.\n2017-12-20 2:04:16 PM v3.96.1\n\nError by Dreddddd\n★\nI have an uncoded error that happens randomly.  It says too many attempts and won’t close or open till later that day.\n2017-12-20 8:21:09 AM v3.96.1\n\nOpen/Close needs to ask for confirmation by FourOfNiner\n★★★\nOperating remotely is an awesome feature but accidental taps can happen.  The app should ask the user to confirm that s/he really wants to open/close the garage.  As simple msgbox that asks “Are you sure you want to open (close)?” would suffice.  Entering password to confirm is too cumbersome.  Face ID confirmation is too easy.\n\nAlso, the beeping alert when closing is a pain in the butt.  How many garage door openers don’t have sensors by the door?  Exactly, none.  At least give the user the option to disable.\n2017-12-20 7:22:37 AM v3.96.1\n\nWorks great! by mblagorio\n★★★★★\nInstalled the myq garage door opener and app and they both work great!\n2017-12-20 6:42:07 AM v3.96.1\n\nVery poor instructions by FracMac\n★\nThe instructions are among the most difficult I’ve used.

At this point I’d say my smart house is brilliant so with all of the programming I have done I am confident it wasn’t me doing something wrong.\n\nThe app is very cluttered to me, I deleted my other linked devices to clean it up some. \n\nSuggestions:\n\nAllow us to select the icon for the door. I have a three car garage, one is a single and one is a double yet the only icon I can select is a single garage door.  It would make it easier those of us over 40 that require reading glasses.  You could have a single door, a double door or a house showing a three car garage with single left and right configurations as well as two single doors and two double doors for other common configurations.  That way we can just tap on the side we want opened. \n\nMy August lock is super easy to read, green circle means unlocked and red circle means locked. You could change the color of the icon with the status.\n\nIf you are Apple HomeKit compatible where is the QR code on my box or in my quick set up guide?  My other stuff was so easy to integrate. \n\nAnd why two apps?  LiftMaster and Chamberlain, you are all the same company, I know I’ve been to your Elmhurst office. Just call it MyQ Garage and you are all set.\n2017-12-19 5:25:47 AM v3.93.3\n\nSadly Disappointed by ThumsUp!\n★★\nWe purchased this particular name brand and model for the app and wifi function. Sadly to find out that the physical operation works just dandy but not the app. It constantly loses connection so I don't get proper reports, I can't operate it remotely nor can I clear the history. Went to the website but no solutions to be found. The app itself doesn't have a way to reset or restore it. Not offered on the website either. Won't recommend it any longer.\n2017-12-19 1:00:19 AM v3.93.3\n\nStraight Forward by sbrunner\n★\nWorks as designed reliably. Simple and clean. Shows states of doors, actuates without noticeable delay. Would be nice to remote control the lights.\n2017-12-18 9:52:12 PM v3.93.3\n\nLatest update fails 75% of the time forcing me to get out of my car and manually close the door by Ludden007\n★\nThey need another update, as the latest one fails consistently. Sure, when it works, it's great. Opening the door almost always works. It's closing the door that I get errors. Says \"too many failed close attempts\" even though I haven't even tried closing it yet. Fix your bugs, Chamberlain.\n2017-12-18 12:13:36 PM v3.93.3\n\nGreat app! by Fashionista135\n★★★★★\nIs is surprisingly easy to use. \nI wasn’t sure how much I like it, but it is really worked well. \n\nNice to know for sure the garage door is closed after you leave, or if somebody opens it up during the day to get the alert.\n2017-12-18 6:28:36 AM v3.93.3\n\nBug ridden and unreliable by jack2493\n★\nOverpriced device that doesn’t work half the time.

It would be nice to be able to chose photos other than a light bulb and a garage door.  Please include other photos.  Again, such as a ceiling fan.\n\nLarry\n2017-12-17 5:45:07 AM v3.93.3\n\nMust Have!!! by 808Peep\n★★★★★\nWe have had this for several years now and LOVE it! Wish we bought it sooner. No more kids forgetting to close the garage or giving out the code. Need something in the house while out of town? Open the door remotely to let someone in. It is worth it! I am NOT paid to review and hardly review things but this was worth it!\n2017-12-16 5:52:15 PM v3.93.3\n\nHorrible service by km002010\n★\nHorrible service\n2017-12-16 3:15:20 PM v3.93.3\n\nHate it. by JeremiahSpangler\n★\nThe MyQ was great when we first set it up. But recently we keep get locked out of it. We get a code that says the door must be operated locally. The first time this happened I couldn't find any info on this problem online so I called there tech support. It sounded like I woke the guy up. Their tech support was very subpar the guy finally told me I had to uninstall the app then reinstall it. This did work after setting it back up. But everyone in my company had to do that and it keeps reoccurring. I would definitely check other options before by the MyQ.\n2017-12-16 2:56:57 PM v3.93.3\n\nDoes not work and customer service is horrible by R3efelipe\n★\nHorrible customer service\n2017-12-16 2:15:51 PM v3.93.3\n\nGreat App by Duchac\n★★★★★\nAfter over a year, nothing better.\n2017-12-16 11:00:27 AM v3.93.3\n\nGreat app by J2sprouse\n★★★★★\nThis app is simple but works consistently every day.\n2017-12-16 7:08:03 AM v3.93.3\n\nConfusing by Rajtxz\n★★\nConfusing setup\n2017-12-16 6:49:01 AM v3.93.3\n\nIt works .. barely by drtimhill\n★★★\nAbout the only thing that can be said for this is app is that it mostly works .. just. But it seems to have been designed by people who had never heard of the concept of customer testing.\n\nFirst, you have to create an account (sigh). And we all know what THAT means from a security standpoint. I’m just waiting for the “we had all N million accounts stolen” email.\n\nNext, anyone who wants to control (say) a garage door from the app must logon to that account. Yes, that’s right, there is NO ability to allow access by family members. Because, of course, no-one has children or partners, right? So you have to share the account credentials with family members. Oh yes, and they promised to fix this .. a year ago. Still waiting.\n\nOh, and you ALWAYS have to go through the account logon screen when you start the app. Even if it has remembered your credentials. Why?\n\nNow for the Apple Watch app, which is hilarious. You open the Apple Watch app, which then sits waiting for you to use the iPhone app to logon to your account .. after which you can go BACK to the Watch app to open or close the garage door. But of course, since you are forced to open the iPhone app (where you can open the garage door), what, precisely, do you save using the Watch app???\n\nWhat a sad mess.\n2017-12-15 11:42:42 PM v3.93.3\n\nFantastic by Hardworking doc\n★★★★★\nIf I forget to close the garage, I can check it and close it from anywhere\n2017-12-15 10:43:03 PM v3.93.3\n\nPush notifications VERY unreliable by ricosuave0922\n★\nThe email notifications work every time but push notifications do not seem to be working anymore.\n2017-12-15 7:42:55 PM v3.93.3\n\nComplicated and inoperable by Magmilio\n★\nI have spent over 2 hours programming the myq garage door opener.

It is really a piece of junk\n2017-12-15 7:13:38 PM v3.93.3\n\nNice product by Cbrcrx5\n★★★★\nInstruction and programming the hub could be a little bit easier and also need that feature where I am pulling up in my car and the door open self to take out the Cell Phone hit the button takes too long\n2017-12-15 2:49:54 PM v3.93.3\n\nShould be an update Wi-Fi option by kiddk1\n★★★★\nExcellent app does everything that I want it to except for one thing if you change your router you have to reprogram the whole thing should be an option to update the Wi-Fi password\n2017-12-14 9:09:06 AM v3.93.3\n\nB970 opener and myQ by Mark C888\n★★★★★\nLove it!  App is great. Opener is Crazy quite, good instruction manual for install. Installed it myself. Lots of features. Worth the higher price if you care about features like built in WiFi, battery backup, motion detection for lights, much more\n2017-12-13 10:06:19 PM v3.93.3\n\nLearning curve isn’t intuitive by Jimbotrav\n★★★\nI have years of satisfaction with Chamberlain garage openers. When I experienced a recent gear disintegration- I saw that as the opportunity to upgrade to the new WiFi equipment. I’m still trying to connect the gateway device and find the waiting time using Customer Support (3x of 10 min. plus) to be ridiculous.\n\nI continue to look forward to having everything work as advertised, and fully expect they will. But between their instructions (down MyQ app) and things not syncing up- I do have an hour+ of frustration. Maybe I’m the only one so please read other reviews.\n2017-12-13 12:28:28 PM v3.93.3\n\nBuggy! by MenloBloom\n★★\nUsed to work great. Latest version gives me a too many attempts to close error when I never even had the app open! I use wall button to open the garage on the way out. Get in my car, open the app. Only then to discover I have to get back out to use the keypad because the error is showing on the app. Terrible experience. Fix it.\n2017-12-13 10:24:34 AM v3.93.3\n\nBest garage opener with wireless adapter by Tony512-Texas\n★★★★★\nThis app works perfect for my needs. Alerts me when the door is open or closed and how long it’s been closed. Has failed me yet! I would give it 10 stars if I could!\n2017-12-13 6:07:04 AM v3.93.3\n\nEasy & safe by Star c\n★★★★★\nThis product is easy to use and the app makes it amazing. I love that I can check if the garage is open from across town, how long it’s been open, and also close it.\n2017-12-12 7:19:00 PM v3.93.3\n\nConstant Errors by Codycomposer\n★\nThis app is incredibly unreliable. If you happen to leave the app open after opening the door and access it later when you’re not near the door, you’ll get an error message. With this latest release, I’m constantly getting an error message and having to reset the door manually. I might as well just have a door opener instead of this app. Not worth it.\n2017-12-11 7:37:46 PM v3.93.3\n\nWorst setup ever by cmftblynu\n★\nNo instructions crappy setup inconsistent directions. Hate it.\n2017-12-11 6:58:49 PM v3.93.3\n\nEasy to use by Grafkuf\n★★★★★\nNever to worry to have access. Easy and reliable.\n2017-12-11 2:36:00 PM v3.93.3\n\nNeeds multi-user functionality by Chrispana\n★\nNow that we’ve installed the opener and the app, we’ve found that the product can only be registered to one user. So we have to all log in with the same user information/email address. The company issued a press release in 2017 stating that the account holder could assign 2 other users on the account who could log in with their own credentials. This is not yet functional. Totally unacceptable! Furthermore, it should not be limited to 3 users. We are a family of 5 and it would be nice if we could all use the app independently.\n2017-12-10 3:28:12 PM v3.93.3\n\nChamberlain openers by Bird99\n★★★★★\nAwesome product\n2017-12-10 1:39:23 PM v3.93.3\n\nGreat Technology by Execgolf4\n★★★★★\nBeen using it for 3 years.

Thanks Chamberlain!\n2017-12-07 12:38:46 PM v3.93.3\n\nNeeds A Confirm Button by Mrs Forgetful\n★★★\nYou certainly have to be careful utilizing this app.  Any slight of the hand will have your garage door open for all to see. It is a great app and very very useful however, it would be nice to have a “CONFIRM” button to validate or insure that any button depression/ selection was an intended one.\n2017-12-07 10:13:35 AM v3.93.3\n\nGarage Door withMq app by How about a updated fix?\n★★★★\nI had to go on Utube to get clear directions on how to install the garage door opener information.

Sad. \n\nAll I wanted was a simple HomeKit accessory to open and close my garage door... Bought this opener after waiting and waiting for them to release the HomeKit enabled version... Then, after it finally was released, I find out it’s two different and separate hubs... I guess one to talk to the opener and one to talk to HomeKit??? Anyway... instead of working “within HomeKit” like they Tech CSR said it would, one still must create an account and upload data to a third party server before you can even set it up. \n\nI LOVE the “minimalist” Apple Way... \n... but this solution is far from it. \n\nI’ll keep it for now, or until a better solution is released, and will update my rating in the future... maybe.\n2017-12-05 4:47:16 PM v3.93.3\n\nOkay product by reellyrollin'\n★★★\nHad weird account issues and device issues after power failure\n2017-12-05 3:47:00 PM v3.93.3\n\nLet me use it by Boodabc\n★★\nThe app immediately started asking for a rating.

I just don’t understand why there is no ability to make widgets. All I want to do is slide over to the widget screen and click a button to open/close the garage door, just like I do with turning on/off my Hue lights. It is just so convenient. Please add this feature.\n2017-12-01 4:01:49 AM v3.93.3\n\nReally really needs option to create shortcut by Cappie dog\n★★\nOnce you get it figured out, it works pretty well. But what it really really really needs is the option to create a “shortcut” button for different places or things it controls that you can put on your main iPhone screen. It should allow me to open or close my garage door by pressing that, without having to open the app, authenticate, and then select to open the garage. It would be even better if the icon could indicate the status, open or closed in my garage door example.\n2017-11-30 9:39:04 PM v3.93.3\n\nLove it so far! by Josh11648648373637\n★★★★★\nHad it for about a week now.

Should have believed the bad reviews.\n2017-11-29 8:44:11 AM v3.93.3\n\nGreat app by Davinci M\n★★★★★\nMy family and I love it, we use it a couple times a day!\n2017-11-27 5:06:18 PM v3.93.3\n\nGreat! by Whamooooooooo\n★★★★★\nSo easy to use, set up, and extremely handy!\n2017-11-27 4:03:30 PM v3.93.3\n\nApp would not detect hub by cebye\n★★\nI tried many times to get the app to connect to the hub.

I began following the instructions step by step. I setup the account and login as well as the password. So I got it to connect to my WiFi and began adding the device so I added my garage door and pressed the learn button on my opener. So it opened my door then closed my door and the app stated the process had failed to register. I tried it again. Same problem failed to register. I then tried it using my wife’s iPhone but no luck with that either. I had to call technical support. After waiting ten minutes to get a human voice to answer. He began walking me thru the process but we came across the same problem failed to register. I he then told me to press the number 1 button on the back of the hub. Then right after pressing 1 he had me press the test button on the sensor. Once we did that the device completed the setup. Whew what a pain the instructions are very poor and needs a technical person to rewrite them. Thanks to tech support my garage door can be opened remotely now.\n2017-11-27 1:15:08 PM v3.93.3\n\nNot dependable by Karena55443322\n★★\nWorks sometimes and then not at all.\n2017-11-27 6:30:10 AM v3.93.3\n\nApp suggestion by LuckyBeaver\n★★★★\nI love the app!

Well over year later and never added feature.\n\nNow that the feature is added they expect us to buy another part to make it work\n2017-11-25 7:27:35 PM v3.93.3\n\nFalse alerts with latest version by ATL_Mike\n★★★\nI've had this app for almost 2 years now and it's always been great. Suddenly, since the last update about a week ago, I'm getting a lot of false alerts. I have alerts set up for when my door opens and when it remains open for 10 minutes. \n\nSince the latest update I'm getting 2 open alerts back-to-back. Sometimes they are within seconds of each other and sometimes they can be 3 - 5 minutes apart. I'm also getting erroneous \"door has remained open\" alerts even though the door had been closed a few minutes earlier.\n2017-11-24 12:40:18 PM v3.93.3\n\nCompletely satisfied. 5 stars!!! by iphonetics\n★★★★★\nNever fails.

My neighbor texted me in San Diego all the way from Tampa Florida where my house is to let me know my son left the garage door open. Whew, so I thanked him and closed it from my present location (way out on the East Coast).

Also when I’ve had that nagging feeling of leaving it open after I’ve left in a hurry. It’s been very convenient for us! Plus, their customer service has been great.

Love the Apple Watch integration.\n\nPlease add Apple CarPlay support!\n2017-11-14 8:28:00 AM v3.93.2\n\nSuggestion by Scrappyiron\n★★★★★\nI love the app and have been using it for several years. We recently purchased a new Chevrolet that didn’t come with the built in garage door remote. However the vehicle does support car play. It would be great if I could add the App to car play so I could open the garage door from the screen in the car.\n\nThank you in advance for thinking about this feature.\n2017-11-14 8:16:08 AM v3.93.2\n\nAlerts stopped working by JSD13\n★★★★\nLatest update killed alerts. No longer being alerted when the garage is left open.\n2017-11-14 8:03:59 AM v3.93.2\n\nNo iPad version. by garageuser\n★★★\nWish there was an iPad version for in wall control.   IFTTT they charge for, should be free\n2017-11-14 6:28:20 AM v3.93.2\n\nThanks! by Trinab79\n★★★★★\nFantastic app for parents that have teens that lose keys! Let them in the house safely from anywhere!\n2017-11-14 5:27:05 AM v3.93.2\n\n$1/month for Google integration? by JEKDC\n★\nWhat a rip off. $1/month just to integrate with Google assistant! What a ridiculous cash grab, no thanks. I regret purchasing a garage that doesn’t integrate with SmartThings or Google or anybody. MyQ is awful.\n2017-11-13 6:46:37 PM v3.93.2\n\nInstall instructions are so bad by dadwojo\n★\nI had to watch several U-tube before I could get this thing to connect.  I still can’t figure out how to connect the second door\n2017-11-13 6:38:24 PM v3.93.2\n\nNo additional accounts by Npkelton895\n★★\nThe app is pretty great, but we only got this system because we expected to be able to have guests have temporary logins and each of us to have our own. We didn’t really want to share one login.\n2017-11-13 5:38:42 PM v3.93.2\n\nLast update opens my garage from time to time by Emanuel user\n★\nLast update opens my garage door from time to time without me interacting with the app. \nIt's terrible since if I don't pay attention I ll end up with a garage opened. \nWhy?!\n2017-11-13 4:50:40 PM v3.93.2\n\nSchedule not fixed by COOLSOTO\n★\nAfter 9 months , still waiting on the schedule fix.

Easy to program\n2017-11-12 3:14:45 PM v3.93.2\n\nGreat App!!!! by Dottie007\n★★★★★\nI love the extra security when being away from home, to just check check to make sure my garage door is closed.\n2017-11-11 6:30:31 PM v3.93.2\n\nGet your Alexa skill working and published by erikmurr\n★\nI purchased this to open my Chamberlain garage door opener and check the status with my Amazon echo devices. I was assured that it would work just to find out it does not. From when I found on the Internet there are great many of us that are greatly disappointed. Please fix immediately and let me know.\n2017-11-11 3:23:39 PM v3.93.2\n\nInaccurate Reports by iskyski\n★\nThe app constantly says my garage door is open when in reality it is actually closed. The alert saying that it is open makes me get up and go check it, and it is always closed. I would be real mad if this were to happen when I am away from my house and have to drive all the way home to find it is actually closed.\n2017-11-10 5:58:54 PM v3.93.2\n\nWORST UPDATE YET! by Pongo5295\n★\nSTAY AWAY from this update! I have been using the app FLAWLESSLY for over a year - no complaints at all.\n\nWith this latest update, I am CONSTANTLY getting \"cannot connect to server\" error messages. Also, History is not updating.\n\nLastly, the Places main screen has ALWAYS stayed updated. I just came home a few minutes ago and the status screen says the garage door was closed over three hours ago rather than just a couple of minutes ago. It ALWAYS was up-to-date. NOT anymore!\n\nNot sure what has changed, but the app is no longer reliable and that's the whole point of the app.\n\nPlease fix!\n2017-11-10 3:26:47 PM v3.93.2\n\nDon’t update by Disapointed also123\n★\nRecent update to the app erased all the data. Now when you open up the app, it doesn’t show any previous garage doors anymore. It’s like setting up a new myQ again!\n2017-11-10 2:18:49 PM v3.93.2\n\nGreat app by Razzledazzl\n★★★★★\nLOVE this app. It lets you know when the door is open or shut so you can tell whose going in and out (kids!) and you can remotely activate the garage door if you need to let someone in. Make sure you have another way to get in in case the app malfunctions, your phone etc.\n2017-11-10 12:56:48 PM v3.93.2\n\nBuena by chamberlon\n★★★★★\nMuy buena\n2017-11-10 11:42:59 AM v3.93.2\n\nDon’t update by Tiz1234536\n★★★\nThe app is great but this last upgrades login button doesn’t work with the newest iOS     \n\nNeeds fixing fast\n2017-11-10 9:16:49 AM v3.93.2\n\nWireless garage door app by Bigkc1997\n★★★★★\nThis is very easy to install. You can do everything on your app from your smart phone. I use this as a security notification for my business. Well worth the money\n2017-11-10 6:57:42 AM v3.93.2\n\nDrops connection WiFi to LTE by daver0001\n★★★\nAt my house it works from my phone.  As I leave the app cannot switch to LTE cellar and hangs up.  Try closing and restarting and it takes forever to connect.  I can enter my keypad code long before the app comes on line.  Just started happening in the last couple weeks.\n2017-11-09 7:21:41 PM v3.93.2\n\nWireless command center by Arrow Inspection\n★★★★★\nOne of the best add ons that can be put on a garage door, 100% worth investment\n2017-11-09 7:16:57 PM v3.93.2\n\nAutomatic remote garage door opener by BBBur\n★★★★★\nReceived today, and installed today.

Will this get fixed at some point?\n2017-11-08 7:58:10 PM v3.93.2\n\nIsn’t working well with new update. by theclassicduck\n★\nAfter this last update the garage keeps saying to many failed attempts with a yellow ”!” Triangle. Great Product but when it doesn’t work or the app is glitched it’s a problem. works once after I plug it back in then the same message appears.\n2017-11-08 7:20:42 PM v3.93.2\n\nWorks as advertised by Branetraveler\n★★★★\nThe Chamberlain app works well and was easy to download, install and implement.  Pleased to see it works with Nest products.  Would add a star if it easily integrated with Alexa from Amazon.\n2017-11-08 5:27:38 PM v3.93.2\n\nNot that quick by omlup\n★★★\nMany times I have to wait until network is connected for me to be able to use this as a routine garage door opener. You line I am in Palm Beach County Florida with good cellular service and yet I have to wait anywhere up to 15 minutes until the app access is the network even though other apps are working just fine\nFor a while, the other nice issue was that there was a symbol on myApple Watch. That unfortunately, is now gone\n2017-11-08 2:11:29 PM v3.93.2\n\nStopped working but now back by Flying Hawaiian.\n★★★★★\nThis update to support X has caused it to stop working. I tried logging in with face ID, then nothing happens. Tried to manually log in, nothing happens.\n\nUpdate\n\nLooks like may have been some server issues but it's working again.\n2017-11-08 12:39:53 PM v3.93.2\n\nGreat app by Ed_Kel\n★★★★★\nUpdate to my original 1 star review. They’ve finally updated the aspect ratio. That was my only gripe.\n2017-11-08 11:03:59 AM v3.93.2\n\nMyQ IYQ by Evil Starr\n★★★★★\nThe home we bought had the garage opener adapter. It just plugged into our router BUT the former owners had to release the ownership of it before we could register it. \nIt has worked great! It tells us how long the door has been closed or open, it lets us open it from anywhere (that we have service) and when you use the app to close it the lights blink and a warning sound goes off before the door lowers to let anyone or a pet know that s”?& is coming down. \nThe chamberlain garage door opener is the only piece of equipment we own.\n2017-11-08 8:57:03 AM v3.93.2\n\nHow do I️ get my money back!! by phxboy80\n★\nI don’t ever write reviews but this one I’m writing. It’s so frustrating when you purchase something and it doesn’t work like you would expect it to. This product is so inconsistent. It works maybe 15% of the time. I would never recommend this product to anyone.\n2017-11-08 8:45:23 AM v3.93.2\n\nCan’t delete history by Stryker396\n★★★\nApp is mostly great except that you can’t delete the history. You can go through the process of deleting it, but after less than a minute, it’s all back again.\n2017-11-08 8:36:19 AM v3.93.2\n\nIt's June 2017 and still no support for iPhone 7+ by Matthew.Koerner\n★★★★★\n***Finally better resolution support and now even for the iPhone X. Thank you!!!”\n\nGuys the app is great but seriously the resolution hasn't been changed for current iPhones??? Please update the resolution!\n\n**update**\nAnother update has gone out and STILL no support for higher resolution.\n\n**UPDATE** \nSince I got a new phone “iPhone X” it asked for me to write a review “again” and well I’m gonna say the same thing. Still no resolution support for other devices. Smh what is it with the developers of this app????\n2017-11-08 8:20:32 AM v3.93.2\n\nSubscription on 3rd Party apps??? Really?!? by gneila\n★\nI find it ridiculous that you want to charge me a monthly fee so I could ask Google to close my garage or IFTTT for that matter. That’s not how it works!\n2017-11-08 7:55:44 AM v3.93.2\n\nDon’t update by Fltgear\n★\nDon’t do the latest update.  The app no longer works at all. It won’t let you log in.\n2017-11-08 7:26:05 AM v3.93.2\n\nMr. Nel by Gio-nel\n★★★★★\nGreat app.\n2017-11-07 8:45:29 PM v3.93.2\n\nNew app is great / Product has been rock solid for over a year by majorgearhead\n★★★★★\nAs promised I am changing my review now that they fixed the app to have retina assets. Never had an issue with the app and now it looks really good on the retina displays. \n\nThank you for listening to your customers on this!\n2017-11-07 2:44:28 PM v3.93.2\n\nAwesome control by Rewire111\n★★★\nWorks 80% of the time and has been convenient at times as well. The disappointment is I rarely get a Message displaying the open Icon showing that the garage door is open, Then when I close it ...turns out I actually opened it, … It’s confusing and risky.\n2017-11-07 9:17:52 AM v3.89.4\n\nSimple to install & implement by 252Gary\n★★★★\nFirst time user / application - easy to setup - did require some research in order to get my two cars programmed. Very happy so far! Telephone app great!\n2017-11-07 7:42:03 AM v3.89.4\n\nGreat product by Method55\n★★★★★\nFlawless operation. Had recent power outage and battery backup took over without an issue. Very pleased.\n2017-11-06 9:27:13 PM v3.89.4\n\nWorks fine. No frills by Chris754334\n★★★★★\nFor just opening and closing the doors remotely and knowing their status, the app works fine. I’m impressed that they added fingerprint recognition.\n2017-11-06 8:57:22 PM v3.89.4\n\nPlease update UI by LatinDanceFactory.com\n★★★\nIt just seems out of date. It works. But a facelift would be nice.\n2017-11-06 9:19:19 AM v3.89.4\n\nHome kit? by cb chef\n★★★★★\nWhy am I paying an extra $50 for a home kit hub. Lame.

Works great especially when set to automatically close garage door after you leave the in case you forget to close it.\n\nNow the I can’t get the door to close. The light and warning sound comes on but the door won’t close. I have to do it manually by the wall button.\n2017-11-05 8:30:16 AM v3.89.4\n\n3D Touch Shortcuts by huntan1\n★\nPlease add the ability to use the app by pressing the icon (3D Touch Shortcuts) and choosing options without having to open the app.\n2017-11-04 11:52:48 PM v3.89.4\n\nImpressive by Wasnatch Jerry\n★★★★★\nMyQ is easy to set-up and it works well with iPhone!\n2017-11-04 10:32:00 AM v3.89.4\n\nVery Pleased by CCz777\n★★★★★\nThis is a simple to use App with everything needed to ensure it works as expected. Thanks Chamberlain!\n2017-11-04 10:30:34 AM v3.89.4\n\nExcited but hesitant by Rusrob0519\n★★★★★\nI have always had the fear that I have left the garage door open. I had to replace my Chamberlain garage door opener due to electrical problems from a storm. I wanted another like product. I was excited to see that Chamberlain had this product, but I was a little hesitant at what it could do. I can express my feelings in three words, “I love it”. Not only can I check to see my garage door is open from miles away, I can even open and close it for someone from a great distance.\n2017-11-04 9:24:45 AM v3.89.4\n\nmy garage by Mesfin G\n★★★★★\noverall this app has worked great with no real issues\n2017-11-04 8:32:30 AM v3.89.4\n\nNice app. by جورج شند\n★★★★★\nIs very good app . Nice to have it. Thank you .\n2017-11-04 1:04:25 AM v3.89.4\n\nTerrible app by maverickfam\n★★\nThis app freezes, doesn’t load half of the time or respond, and is hit or miss on showing my linked appliances. Really hope the app improves because it’s incredibly disappointing to purchase a wi-fi garage opener only to have it work a portion of the time.\n2017-11-03 3:51:30 PM v3.89.4\n\nNot working in IOS 11.1 by From_R7\n★\nMy app is no longer working in IOS 11.1  it’s deleted all my information once I actually get into the app and just crashes\n2017-11-03 3:48:36 PM v3.89.4\n\nChamberlain products need major improvement by gnrlwarf\n★\nThe MyQ app is dead slow! It does not seem to remember my login credentials between sessions. It requires multiple login attempts before finally connecting.

Flawless and reliable. App is very intuitive. Alerts tell me whenever a family member or potential intruder is coming or going.\n2017-11-02 7:16:33 AM v3.89.4\n\nGet kicked out of the app by Glen's Phone\n★★★\nMy wife and I both like the roll up door opener but the app kicks us both out often. Then you have to login in again.\n2017-11-02 6:12:49 AM v3.89.4\n\nTrouble connecting by RussellWMcConnell\n★\nOccasionally requires me to log in, which defeats the purpose while driving\n2017-11-01 6:29:36 PM v3.89.4\n\nNo google home or Alexa by Simple Autos\n★\nNo free integration with either google home and Alexa..\n2017-11-01 5:21:12 PM v3.89.4\n\nToo many false alarms by JP1437\n★\nThe door sensor appears to be too sensitive. False alarms. Can only guess the wind giggles the door and triggers the sensor. Wish it was not based on a tilt mechanism but more like a standard door sensor.\n2017-10-31 5:36:37 PM v3.89.4\n\nTo many problems by Jacarr44\n★\nI have had many problems and the service department would benefit from training and providing a decent customer service. I was even very hard to order parts.\n2017-10-31 5:18:20 PM v3.89.4\n\nAwesome app but could’ve been all in one. by J-Stretch\n★★★★\nI love that I could give my mother the door opener and I use my phone to get the door open. The only issue I have is that I wish the garage door opener came with Apple HomeKit already included in the door opener rather than buying a separate piece. But the app works just fine. Also another issue I’m having is the Apple Watch app keeps asking me to login to my app before using it and When I do login it still doesn’t work. It keeps asking me to login and doesn’t leave that page. Is there anything I could do on my end to fix that?\n2017-10-31 4:59:33 PM v3.89.4\n\nDoes the job by 1675aaaa\n★★★★\nThe app is simple to configure and use. It does seem to lose connection to the server when you try to open it too quickly after it has closed. However, aside from when I was testing it, I’ve had no problems with it. It would be nice to have a guest account feature.\n2017-10-31 7:24:55 AM v3.89.4\n\nWorks by RedMGTD\n★★★★★\nWorks well. When away and I think, \"Did I close the garage door?\" Now I can easily check with this app.\n2017-10-30 8:47:29 PM v3.75.1\n\nCharging for IFTTT integration. by ColonalKohler\n★\nIt is absurd to think you can charge for integrating to other apps like IFTTT. Having to pay $1 a month just to use a feature is a terrible idea.\nNobody buy this, show them we won’t stand for this kind of behavior.\n2017-10-30 5:21:54 PM v3.89.4\n\nWorks great, but ads in app disappoint by the boognish\n★★★★★\nThis works as designed although recent software updates make the app slower to open and introduced advertisements. Now, that would be fine if I had not bought the opener but I did so why am I getting adverts. You already have my email, don’t hit me up with ads in an app that supports the product I bought.\n2017-10-30 7:40:41 AM v3.89.4\n\nWhen working, it's great by Idaholistener\n★★★★\nMy only hesitation with this device came last November when the bridge acted strange and wouldn't let me log in. I reset the bridge several times and the light kept blinking. The app kept telling me there was an error. That happened on two separate occasions and persisted for about a week both times. Prior to that there were no problems. Since the second time, there have not been issues either, but that shook my confidence a bit. If not for that, it is a great app in that it tells you the current status of the garage door, and how long it's been down. There's not much more that someone would need. A running log of opening and closing would probably be the ultimate upgrade they could provide. Beyond that, there isn't anything I can think of that they could do with the system as it stands. For me, it's convenient to open my door when I'm on a walk and a few houses down, but I've yet to need to open it remotely from a distance. After the glitch I had, I'm hesitant to open it without knowing for sure I can close it. But it is really nice to check remotely to see if family members made it home for the night. It's also great to make sure the door is down without getting out of bed. If you are someone who gets halfway to your destination and forgets whether you shut the door, you can just hop on the app and check.\n2017-10-29 10:49:10 PM v3.89.4\n\nGood but slow on email alerts by DrWhoApp\n★★★★\nI would like to see alerts as SMS text. After various tries at email accounts they are very slow to send. Delays are a problem when dealing with forgotten open door.\n2017-10-29 3:35:40 PM v3.89.4\n\nGood but needs another app by mhitewatt\n★★★\nCurrent app works ok, they need an app for CarPlay so we can open our garage doors as we pull up to the house...\n2017-10-29 3:10:02 PM v3.89.4\n\nSmart Garage- A must have! by Kanzzzr\n★★★★★\nThis easy app made installation a breeze, now I can rest assured my house is closed up.\n2017-10-29 2:27:22 PM v3.89.4\n\nAlexa by zpak69\n★★★★★\nWish Alexa could integrate with MyQ.

Try figure out better printing or avoid using D\n2017-10-28 6:12:10 PM v3.89.4\n\nWorks well by Mikejsc\n★★★★\nI would give it 5 stars if the app would send me a notification when the garage door is open after a designated time.\n2017-10-28 6:06:38 PM v3.89.4\n\nWorks by Sailor03\n★★★★\nWorks as advertised!\nExcept it interferes with my normal openers.\n2017-10-28 5:22:53 PM v3.89.4\n\nApp stuck by M.McDonald\n★\nApp is stuck on the first step.

At times it trips off and must be reset.  The three times this has happened I was out of town for several days.  Reset is easy but a nuisance since I’m often away. Great system when it works.\n2017-10-27 2:24:50 PM v3.89.4\n\nAwesome!!! by Alvin Lopez\n★★★★★\nLove this App.\n2017-10-27 12:41:47 PM v3.89.4\n\nVery convenient. by N1jb14\n★★★★\nConvenient.

We don’t even have conventional garage door remotes anymore.\n2017-10-26 8:39:53 AM v3.89.4\n\nPeriodic not responsive by sbl_91\n★★\nThere is a chord with this app which causes it to not respond when I read my garage when I am on Wi-Fi from my home. I tap the Chrysler symbol and then gives me the spinning circle. About half a mile later it will say unresponsive. Then when I clear that and hit the garage door symbol it will go down. Please work on this bug.\n2017-10-26 8:20:30 AM v3.89.4\n\nMyQ = good, but not great by MeteorologistWannaBe\n★★\nMost who have tried to set up MyQ have likely encountered issues with the less than desirable instructions. Once set up, the MyQ app is a good tool, however, Chamberlain’s greed ruined the possibility of opening and closing the garage door using IFTTT with Google Home without having to pay to upgrade the service. Seriously, allowing people to use their voice instead of their fingers is worth charging an added fee? I feel sorry for the amputees that are being discriminated against. Everyone should enjoy free access to be able to open and close their garage door. Shame on Chamberlain for being greedy and charging the added fee to those seeking convenience.\n2017-10-25 7:00:40 AM v3.89.4\n\nWow that was easy by the bge\n★★★★★\nEasy to install and setup.

Anytime I forget or thought I forgot to close my garage I can simply check it out and have piece of mind that my house is secured. It is also great if you need to let someone in your place. I have had this for several years now and the only problem I have ever had is operator error when I can't remember my password to get in, works seemless.\n2017-10-22 2:07:25 PM v3.89.4\n\nHomeKit by Anti political\n★\nIt’s ridiculous you have to buy an accessory to make HomeKit work for openers that already have WiFi built in.

I do this every couple days. \n\nCalling support is an absolute joke.

You can have the delivery company contact you and you can open the garage door for them - no code to give out. It can alert you when the door opens and closes - now you know if the kids are playing around with it. In a rush to get to work and then think “did I remember to close the garage door?” This app verifies that. \nWonderful peace of mind and ease of convenience!\n2017-10-20 4:48:07 AM v3.89.4\n\nGarage opener by sbubrick\n★★★★★\nValery in your customer service dept. is one of the best reps your company could possibly want.

During the step to press the #2 button to transfer settings from the MyQ Smart Garage, the correct button to press is actually #1. I spent hours trying to set up the MyQ Home Bridge unsuccessfully and had to reconfigure my MyQ Smart Garage twice; which requires shutting off my Wi-Fi network for it to reset properly. Please update this app to have the proper steps to avoid other customers from going through the time consuming process of frustration.\n2017-10-16 1:03:57 PM v3.89.4\n\nBuggy by Momo@54\n★\nTook several hours to get this working.

This app looks outdated and feels cheap. Where do you get off charging me to use other free services?? I get it you probably have to offset the cost of your AWS servers but still it’s a little annoying when you charge for free OPEN SOURCE products and can’t help users by publishing the documentation needed!\n2017-10-15 9:39:17 PM v3.89.4\n\nGood app by iPhoneLover4\n★★★★★\nWorks well!

The setup booklets aren’t very helpful for IOS and all of the info on the Chamberlain website tells users to go to Apple.com for anything related to HomeKit.  Lame.  It isn’t straightforward to add the Chamberlain MyQ Home Bridge to HomeKit.  The least they can do is tell you how.  Can’t get it to work with HomeKit.\n2017-10-14 1:21:07 PM v3.89.4\n\nAwesomeness by Kenwould\n★★★★★\nThis is an awesome product.  Works great every time.

With the ability to open and close.\n2017-10-14 12:45:27 AM v3.89.4\n\nPernsteiner by T Pesky\n★★★★★\nSuper convenient\n2017-10-13 6:12:25 PM v3.89.4\n\nGarage Door by dasox\n★\nThis door opens when we're not home, the app doesn't allow door to close minutes after door is open. Getting a replacement through HomeDepot, this whole opener is defective, door wouldn't close and nothing blocking sensors.\n2017-10-13 5:14:07 PM v3.89.4\n\nErases Stored Settings by Spauthy\n★★\nDownload this app if you like the challenge of resetting all your information.  Once again I updated the app as recommended and it wiped out my garage door settings.  Nice feeling when you are not at home and need to control your doors.  Thank you Chamberlain!\n2017-10-13 9:30:09 AM v3.89.4\n\nThe only company that is putting a pay up by Nsa1581\n★\nThey require you to pay a monthly or yearly subscription to work with google home and another subscription to work with ifttt. Worst company to enter the smart things market.\n2017-10-13 8:37:20 AM v3.89.4\n\nExcellent by JR Roberts\n★★★★★\nKnow when door is opened, can open for housekeeper or contractor via mobile.... Excellent! Motion detector light comes on when i enter garage from house, & have door set to the minimum of 5 minutes before it closes in case i forget to close. Excellent product!\n2017-10-12 9:55:02 PM v3.89.4\n\nGood, could be great by Marquezd1\n★★★\nOverall the app is fine and simple to use. Once in a while there's a hiccup with the hardware saying the garage door has opened when it truly hasn't. That makes it hard to trust it 100%. It's still a must have.\n10/12/17 now it has too many issues where it just won’t close or false open/close.\n2017-10-12 7:15:05 PM v3.89.4\n\nWorks better than expected by surfbgull\n★★★★★\n...only a single \"hang\" since installing the app last year. Clean interface, multiple devices...it's truly indispensable and reliable beyond expectations.\n2017-10-12 5:46:11 PM v3.75.1\n\nReally Impressive Opener by Insoak\n★★★★★\nI looked for a couple hours on line with the Home Depot and Lowe’s web sites and decided on the Chamberlain HD950F opener. Installed myself in 4.5 hours. That included programming the cars, remotes, wall unit, and the phone. Super quite and the app is really easy to use. Very impressed with everything.\n2017-10-12 10:52:34 AM v3.89.4\n\nApple like quality by BayAreaParent\n★★★★★\nEasy to install, it just works. Bravo!\n2017-10-11 8:54:55 PM v3.89.4\n\nOne feature missing and it’ll be perfect by Only for this stupid review\n★★★★\nEverything with the chamberlain has been good. I just wish they would have an option for auto close in a given time. There’s no option to set auto close in the app.\n2017-10-11 8:45:22 PM v3.89.4\n\nGarevr by Appperro\n★★★★★\nWork perfectly\nBest choice \nWorth the money \nA+++++\n2017-10-11 2:32:27 PM v3.89.4\n\nDoor Opened Continuously! by TaylorPrince60\n★★\nI had to remove the pad from the wall because the door was opening erroneously. It’s a good thing my neighbor was going to the store or I could have been here with the garage door open all night. I read other reviews that mentioned similar events. I’m very disappointed and hope that Chamberlain will work out these glitches!\n2017-10-11 2:26:07 PM v3.89.4\n\nGreat by Tour24\n★★★★★\nGreat app\n2017-10-11 1:29:58 PM v3.75.1\n\nschedule is notworking by yesyesyesagain\n★\nCan't save schedule\n2017-10-11 10:49:46 AM v3.89.4\n\nNovelty Item by James1971a\n★★\nHad for nearly a year, works when I want to ‘show it off’. Not dependable when I ‘need’ it. Also, phantom operation is a real issue. We believe we have fixed ours, but still makes me uneasy knowing my door may function unwittingly. Has Apple Watch functionality, but won’t work unless your phone is unlocked so not much use there.\n2017-10-11 7:58:41 AM v3.89.4\n\nDoes not integrate with other home applications and some very stupid features by iphone user\n★★\nChamberlin is really behind the curve with other products that are much more integrated with things like Alexa, Google, Apple HomeKit etc. They then have the nerve to charge you $12 a year to have it integrate with IFTTT. Now they want to sell a $50 Apple HomeKit hub, which is not their fault, but still a pain. The application supposedly links with Nest but it is a joke as nest already has its own app and they need you to manually use this app to open or close your garage\nDoor and then swipe to the nest icons and then manually turn off or on your nest thermostats or set them to home or away manually. LOL. That is not automation and no integration whatsoever. Very funny and very misleading. Until they get their game together with integration go with one of the other brands\n2017-10-11 1:26:52 AM v3.89.4\n\nWorks great! by Spidereddie\n★★★★★\nSimple and effective. Open the app. Tap the garage icon and the door opens when closed or closes when open\n2017-10-10 7:45:39 PM v3.75.1\n\nDoes one function really well. Not updated for bigger iPhone screens by pdgill\n★★\nThis app lets you control things (off/on and up/down) and notifies you of such but it hasn’t been updated since iPhone 5 for screen size. That is annoying and denotes a lack of attention to detail or care. \n\nIs there a reason you guys haven’t updated it?\n2017-10-10 11:46:15 AM v3.89.4\n\nNousy door by GEV8\n★★★★\nMotor is significantly noisier 1 yr after purchase.\n2017-10-09 8:32:19 PM v3.89.4\n\nGreat product by hemalkpatel\n★★★★★\nWorks perfect with my MyQ enabled garage.\n2017-10-09 8:27:08 PM v3.89.4\n\nRecent failures by Merlinx454\n★\nWorks great when it works. I had to reprogram it 4 times in the last month.\n2017-10-09 10:04:15 AM v3.89.4\n\nEasy setup, mostly reliable by exhilar8r\n★★★★\nNearly always reliable, which is an issue, since you’re left wondering if the notifications are accurate. At one point I was getting notified of openings while at work. That’s stopped, but now it tells me that I’m leaving the door open after I drive away, which isn’t true. Seems to have started after iOS 11, but not sure. We’ll see what happens with future updates. Needs customizable notifications also.\n2017-10-09 8:21:54 AM v3.89.4\n\nNo Lock for iPhone App? by Linkin Mark\n★★\nIt does connect to the garage so that’s fine. I wish there were more options in the app. Like, “Lock the garage unless I use a password from inside the app.” That way, if I’m out of town, i can hard lock the whole system. This was important to me and I’m sad it wasn’t included. I’ll give more stars if you include more robust features.\n2017-10-09 3:41:50 AM v3.89.4\n\nIt's okay but why not make it really smart? by The_Morrisons\n★★\nOk, pretty cool.  I can sit a home and push the app button to open and close my garage door.  I can even do this from the coffee shop (not sure of the reason).\n\nWhy not make this app into something useful?\n- alarm me when the door doesn't close because of the sensors activating it (left a shovel under the door)\n- automatically open the door when my phone comes back into wifi range (you know...I'm home again)\n- alert me when the door is open at a custom time range and provide the option to auto shut the door (in case I go to bed and forgot to shut it)\n- give me the option to fully lockout anyone entering the garage at a custom time range (like when I'm in bed)...alert me if someone tries to enter.\n- let me program when the light come on/off\n- let me remotely set a temporary passcode for entry\n- Track how many times my door has opened and closed and provide me with maintenance recommendations...maybe even tie into a service that automatically comes out to lubricate/adjust springs/alignment/service opener\n\nYou could make this into something that is really useful...right now it is something that is just really expensive.  Nice part about it is that  all you have to do is program the app and update it...oh yeah and decide to do it.  Hey, maybe I should be the product manager for this product now!\n2017-10-08 8:49:27 PM v3.89.4\n\nAmazing by Shirazm\n★★★★★\nMy family has never been more safe . \nEveryone knows when the the garage is opened and closed. \n\nThank you\n2017-10-08 5:01:39 PM v3.89.4\n\nLove the app by $gjet$\n★★★★★\nWorks great and is awesome for deliveries where I’m not home!\n2017-10-08 2:01:15 PM v3.89.4\n\nCrap by Kenwhip\n★\nWorked for a week and then quit working not worth the money don’t bother buying the app is also not working\n2017-10-08 1:38:40 PM v3.89.4\n\nHate how I had to rate it by dglandorf\n★\nYou are prompted non stop to rate the app.  It is a terrible app as a result.\n2017-10-08 11:34:19 AM v3.89.4\n\nRbdorris by Muff- ster\n★★★\nA little tricky to set up .link emails slow to come to in box.But works fine so far.\n2017-10-08 11:04:22 AM v3.89.4\n\nApp resolution stuck in 2012 by audiblethoughts\n★★★★\nGreat app! It does what it needs to do. But can we please update the resolutions to iPhone 8 and 8+ sizes. It’s been 3 years with these new resolutions and Chamberlain is still rocking iPhone 5 screen sizes. And with the iPhone X on the horizon these boys should get with the program.\n2017-10-08 11:02:34 AM v3.89.4\n\nBest neighbor ever by Light Family\n★★★★★\nBefore we had an app that reminded us we left the garage door open, our poor neighbor had to call all of the time!

For my door open or door closed notifications I used to get one notification with the time. Now I get several repeat notifications with the same time stamp. I’ve gotten as many at 12 door just opened notifications with the same time stamp. Same for door closed notifications. Some times only two or three notifications but rarely just one. :(\n2017-10-07 12:02:50 PM v3.89.4\n\nSecurity liability by grivitz\n★★\nThe app is a big toggle button.

If you opening a garage door from app and someone calling you at the same time, app just stopped working and you stuck. Or Neigborh has opener using the same frequency like your garage door opener then your garage door will be opened without your knowledge. Bad! Bad!

I’m ready to leave MyQ and find something else... almost all other smart home products work with IFTTT for free! I already gave you money for the products. \n\nUntil they either update their scheduling or allow IFTTT/Smartthings for free, they are still getting 1 Star.  \n\n——\nSchedules need updating- addition of items like run on sunset or sunrise for the lighting items would be great! \n\nIntegration into IFTTT or Smartthings would also be great.\n2017-10-05 7:23:29 PM v3.89.4\n\nRange limited by Cruise Director\n★★\nThe range to the WiFi hub is limited to 15ft in my case.

No more guessing about whether the garage door is closed.  Simple to set up.  Easy to use.  Recommend highly.\n2017-10-03 4:45:05 PM v3.89.4\n\nGarage Door Convenience by Jon Tkach\n★★★★★\nIt is such a convenience to open the door upon arriving at the house.  Also it's great to open the door on occasion when a workman arrives when no one is home yet so he can get started without waiting.  I love it!\n2017-10-03 11:32:39 AM v3.89.4\n\nWorse than not having by Zoro Oscuro\n★\nI bought this system hoping to never get to work and have to wonder if I left the garage door open. Unfortunately, this thing throws so many false positives that it is worse than not having it. Is it better to wonder if I forgot to close the door or to receive an email that I left it open when I didn't?\n2017-10-02 9:27:50 PM v3.89.4\n\nHorrible Connectivity by Commish66\n★\nIt works very inconsistently and tech support is nowhere.\n\nStop the Pop-ups when I’m trying to use it!\n2017-10-02 5:53:46 AM v3.89.4\n\nWorks fine but it's too large by DaveL17\n★★\nThe app works as advertised, but there's no reason for such a simple app to use 130 MB of memory. The app to run my TiVo is only 30 MB.\n2017-10-02 4:51:58 AM v3.89.4\n\nAwesome opener by Local473\n★★★★★\nI've had 2 craftsman openers (and they were not bad), but I love my Chamberlain. You ever got to work and wondered \"Did I close the door?\" Well no need to worry again. You can check from your phone.\n2017-10-01 9:25:39 PM v3.89.4\n\nIntegration by SDCAJim\n★★★\nNeeds integration with Amazon Echo\n2017-10-01 3:54:48 PM v3.89.4\n\nUseless app with new iOS by Acjetpilot\n★\nSince I can’t use this app with the new iOS (driving feature enabled prevents launching of apps) and as an added bonus, model B550 requires a compatibility bridge to work with my vehicle. Overall, I’d say this chamberlain model B550 and the app both are a POS.\n2017-10-01 9:02:05 AM v3.89.4\n\nVery reliable by Justin 34\n★★★★★\nI think the app has been great and very stable.\n2017-10-01 7:42:27 AM v3.89.4\n\nBest product ever. by mfc8890dw\n★★★★★\nBest product ever.\n2017-09-30 7:12:53 PM v3.89.4\n\nChamberlain works like champ by Hansaran\n★★★★★\nEasy to install and I was able to link to wink hub network.\n2017-09-30 5:42:29 PM v3.89.4\n\nGarage by Feri33\n★★★★★\nLike the fact that I have control of my garage door from anywhere.\n2017-09-30 12:31:20 PM v3.89.4\n\nUnable to pair with iPhone by robert.fleming\n★\nUnable to pair garage with iphone\n2017-09-30 7:50:34 AM v3.89.4\n\niOS 11 issues by F1Michael\n★\nNot working on iPhone 6S on iOS 11.0.1. Also pretty annoying that the app is not native resolution. Hire some competent developers please.\n2017-09-29 11:43:09 AM v3.89.4\n\nAdded features by Earthspace\n★★★★\nI would like to have a feature that sends notifications about garage being open to long\n2017-09-28 10:09:22 PM v3.89.4\n\nChamberlain by Mendicino\n★★★★★\nOutstanding. Works great. I love I got it\n2017-09-28 9:10:12 PM v3.89.4\n\nA lifesaver by Streetkredd\n★★★★★\nGreat when your kids beat you home. I know when they walk in the door.\n2017-09-28 1:45:41 PM v3.89.4\n\nContinuous false positives by Downtempo20028\n★\n2-3x a day the app reports the garage has been opened when in fact it has not.\n\nSeriously the worst hardware app combo ever\n2017-09-28 12:14:00 AM v3.89.4\n\nNeeds to update to new SDK by Pyretech\n★\nApp works fine, it’s just using an ancient SDK. Also annoying that every other time you open the app it wants you to rate it with no option for never.\n2017-09-27 10:58:22 PM v3.89.4\n\nDoor order issue by FindAHappyPlace\n★★★\nI have two doors side by side. Visually it would make sense to have them match their position in the app. Is that possible? Believe it or not it isn’t! I commented on this quite a while ago and it still hasn’t been fixed. So many apps have basic ordering methods, this isn’t rocket science. Please fix!\n2017-09-27 2:01:57 PM v3.89.4\n\nLove my Chamberlain! by Steltex\n★★★★★\nThe wireless garage door opener is wonderful. It is so nice to be able to open and close my garage door remotely as well as seeing when somebody else has opened it. It has worked perfectly since installation two years ago.\n2017-09-26 10:19:16 PM v3.89.4\n\nMy Q Garage by THOMLAH\n★★★★★\nI had the chain driven garage opener, then it broke. This allowed me to upgrade to the “quiet” belt driven garage opener. When I upgraded some nice new features came with the garage opener. 1.  Wall remote opener for outside the garage, this can be programmed for guess, 2 car remotes, motion sensor for garage light, IOS app that allows you to open the garage door from anywhere (Wi-Fi needed to work), Just love the upgrades came with this garage unit.\n2017-09-26 8:34:35 PM v3.89.4\n\nChamberlain Garage Door Opener by Thirsty Bear\n★★★★★\nI would give it 6 stars if I could. Works great. Never wonder if you forgot to close the garage door again. Get a wi-fi extender if you have poor reception.\n2017-09-26 8:18:31 PM v3.89.4\n\nVery easy to setup by Scrapguy\n★★★★★\nHad no problem with setup, works to my expectations\n2017-09-26 6:19:44 PM v3.89.4\n\nWorks perfect by Dssmaster\n★★★★★\nCan’t be happier always work and they send email with updates when will not work.\n2017-09-26 9:58:06 AM v3.89.4\n\nGreat! by CarGuy46\n★★★★★\nReplaced a 1/4 hp chain drive unit that was extremely loud.  This one is quiet senses movement and turns on light, very helpful. Battery backup got us in after hurricane. Can check whether door is open or closed from smartphone when you forget if you closed it.  Would give it more stars if they were available.\n2017-09-26 7:55:05 AM v3.89.4\n\nNoWorysMan by AKtwinn\n★★★★★\nNoWorysMan\n2017-09-26 3:00:39 AM v3.89.4\n\nClose to good, not great, poor support. by graybrick\n★★\nApp does not transfer from WiFi to cellular well, and constantly gives “network issue” warnings. Does not always confirm control or door/Gate position. HomeKit works for garage doors, but not gate controllers (both work in app) - support is woefully untrained.\n2017-09-25 9:09:31 PM v3.89.4\n\nAlways loses connection by Thogan32\n★★★★\nSince recent updates seems to fix the connectivity issues. Would be really cool if it had car play features.\n\nUsed to work great but lately the gateway loses its connection. This is very frustrating when you are in a hurry. Shows connected to my network but app keeps saying offline.\n2017-09-25 9:06:52 PM v3.89.4\n\nGreat by bundyswa\n★★★★\nSaved my butt more than once when I forgot to close the door, or just wanted to be sure. Works if you forget a garage door opener too. Nice app\n2017-09-25 7:31:07 PM v3.89.4\n\nDoes what I need but should do more by DJeTron\n★★\nThe app opens and closes my garage door without fail. I use this as my primary garage door opener and don’t need a controller in my car anymore. Would be nice to have a widget to make it faster to open and close that also shows door status. An alert if it’s open for XX amount of time would be great too. And please please please update it so it looks right on the iPhone plus. 5 stars once the widget is added and resolution is updated!\n2017-09-25 11:05:19 AM v3.89.4\n\nGreat basic open/close but... by Eagleviews\n★★★\nPLEASE add IFTTT or ADT integration.\n2017-09-25 10:06:09 AM v3.89.4\n\nNot working by rban111\n★\nNot working\n2017-09-25 7:35:38 AM v3.89.2\n\nMyQ retofit by anyamot\n★★★★★\nWorks like magic. Made my older liftmaster opener hi-tech. Install kinda tricky. If you are having problem connecting to your wifi, set it up closer to the router before installing the \"brain\" in your garage wall\n2017-09-24 7:03:46 PM v3.89.2\n\nRocket Science by droid269\n★★★★\nAfter searching the web for hours, I found instructions to pair MyQ with Home Kit. The instructions looked like you something I would need to hire a computer programmer to get this to work. Screwed again.\n2017-09-24 12:47:45 AM v3.89.2\n\nNeed improvements by Bannu85\n★★\nFalse notifications are receiving. UI should be lot better\n2017-09-23 8:22:19 PM v3.89.2\n\nThe BEST by Clay_Lin721\n★★★★★\nThis garage opener runs when you have no electricity!  When we had no electricity for over 24 hrs!  Awesomeness!😊\n2017-09-23 7:24:53 PM v3.89.2\n\niPhone 8 by Mainecoon 078\n★★★★\nCan’t log in!  Either gives an incorrect password entered or nothing happens when log in pressed\n2017-09-23 2:44:57 PM v3.89.2\n\nGood idea, poor execution by BoomerBroadway\n★\nApp constantly falls off network and logs me out. App looks very plain and ugly. Have to buy a $60 piece to make it home kit compatible!? Not very stable. When it works, it's great. When it doesn't, I get locked out of my house.\n2017-09-23 12:56:12 PM v3.89.2\n\nGood app by Angry mayur\n★★★★★\nHelps opening and closing garage doors. Also notifies you if garage door remained open\n2017-09-23 10:56:03 AM v3.75.1\n\nStill no homekit by Rossking2\n★\nLied to was told home kit would be a future feature but now need to buy new unit\n2017-09-22 11:52:36 PM v3.89.2\n\nGood but some login issues by DJ B3\n★★★★\nIt works well most of the time. There are times when it forces me to login with my credentials yet if I close the app quickly and reopen it, it seems to go right to the garage door without logging in again. I just wish it would work consistently with touch ID so I didn’t have to login and stop to put my car in park etc.\n2017-09-22 10:10:38 PM v3.89.2\n\nGotta Love it😊 by Tabitha41\n★★★★★\nLove my Chamberlain garage opener 😉😉\n2017-09-22 9:02:21 PM v3.89.2\n\nVery convenient by Little Green Car\n★★★★★\nIt's really convenient to have an app on my phone to check if I closed the door, for sure or when I'm not using My car and want to enter and exit through the garage. \nThis opener is also so much quieter than the opener I had before.\n2017-09-22 8:22:29 PM v3.89.2\n\nError by kathymarkandgeny\n★\nHaving a lot of error problems\n2017-09-22 6:17:50 PM v3.89.2\n\nOutdated by 897adnDIazzz\n★\nApp is still scaled on 7+. Looks really bad. \n\nAlso, charging for Google Home integration? Outrageous! Will never pay. No other service charges me for that sort of integration.\n2017-09-22 2:27:03 PM v3.89.2\n\nWorld Class! by MissyAndrU\n★★★★★\nThis makes life sooo easy!\n2017-09-22 1:26:03 PM v3.89.2\n\nIt  works. by Jj5j\n★★★\nIt opens and closes your door\n2017-09-22 10:12:06 AM v3.75.1\n\nTime saver from hell!!! by 2wcedafun\n★★★★★\nIf you are like me, who most of the time turns around 2 miles down the road to triple check you've closed the garage door, you need look no further!!!! Not to mention the numerous times I've remotely given access to friends and familly to just the garage (hey, do you have a?) and then assured again that my house was left secured.\n\nOutstanding!!!\n2017-09-22 4:15:40 AM v3.89.2\n\n"
